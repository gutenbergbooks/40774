<h2><a name="THE_MAGIC_WINDOWS" id="THE_MAGIC_WINDOWS">THE MAGIC WINDOWS</a></h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Did you ever hear of the Magic Windows?
Those who look through them behold many
strange and beautiful sights. If you will but
make them your own, you may enter the
fairyland of wonder and see all its rich
treasures.</p>

<p>You ask me how you can do this? I will
answer by telling you a story.</p>

<p>There was once a happy boy who played
through the long summer days. And where
he played the meadows were green, and the
sky was blue, and the sunshine was bright.</p>

<p>On every side the flowers nodded like smiling
playmates. Birds chirped to him from
the bushes. The rabbits gave him a friendly
look as they went leaping by. The squirrels
watched him with bright eyes as they ran up
and down the trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>A little brook flowed through the meadows.
On its sandy bed the happy boy found bright
pebbles. His toy ships sailed proudly upon
its waves or rested in the quiet harbors along
its banks. Tiny fishes darted from their hiding
places to eat the crumbs which he threw
into the water.</p>

<p>"I wonder where the brook goes," said the
happy boy. "I should like to follow it and
see. How I wish the school bell would never
call me from my play! I would rather sail
my boat than learn to read, and I like the
rabbits and squirrels better than my books."</p>

<p>The little brook heard the boy's words as
it went flowing by. On its way to the great
river it ran through a forest where fairyland
was hidden. There it told the fairies of the
happy boy and of his wishes.</p>

<p>By and by the sun went down and playtime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
ended. Night came, and the Shut-eye
train carried the boy far away to the Land
of Slumber.</p>

   <img src="images/p0013a-illus.png" alt="A squirrel" title="A squirrel" />
</div>

<p>There a wise fairy met the
happy boy. "Come with me,"
she said, "and I will let you
look through Magic Windows
into a land of wonders."</p>

<p>Through the Magic Windows
the boy looked with delight. All the things
that he had ever wished to see were before
him. There were the hiding places of the
wild birds. There were
the animals that live
in the fields and in
the woods.</p>

<p>He could look
into the birds' nests
that hung on the
tallest trees. He
could peep into
the holes where the
squirrels kept their
little ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>He could see the mole digging long halls
under ground. He could watch the spider as
it spun the silk for its curious house.</p>

<p>Rabbits were hiding their young in the
long grass, and little foxes were playing by
their rocky dens.</p>

<p>He could even see the bear's cubs curled
up like balls in the hollow trunks of trees.</p>

<p>"Look to the north," said the fairy.</p>

   <img src="images/p0014-illus.png" alt="A polar bear" title="A polar bear" />
</div>

<p>And then the happy boy looked away over
the great round
world. He saw
strange lands
and strange people.
Far off in
the north he
could see the
land of snow
and ice. There were the homes of the seal,
the reindeer, and the white bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Children dressed in fur crept out of snow
houses. They went dashing over the snow in
sleds drawn by dogs.</p>

<p>Again the happy boy looked, and the wonder
lands of the south lay before him. Gay
flowers blossomed everywhere. Bright-colored
birds found a safe home in the great forest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="p0015-illus.png" id="p0015-illus.png"></a>
   <img src="images/p0015-illus.png" alt="Two lions" title="Two lions" />
</div>

<p>He could see the lion and his mate in their
home. Hundreds of monkeys played in the
branches of the trees. Tigers ran through
the tall grass, and huge elephants pushed
their way among the trees and bushes.</p>

<p>Once more the happy boy looked through
the Magic Windows, and oh, how wonderful!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
He could see into fairy land where animals
talk, and where the playthings are
alive.</p>

<p>"Oh, kind fairy, let me stay here," said
the happy boy. "I can not leave this land
of wonders."</p>

<p>"Would you like to have the Magic Windows
for your own?" asked the fairy. "Then
listen well. When the school bell rings, it
will call you to the land of books. Through
the Magic Windows of your books you may
see greater wonders than fairies can tell or
fairy land can show."</p>

<p>Another day came with the rising sun.
Once more the school bell rang. Gladly the
happy boy left his play, for in his books he
would find the Magic Windows.</p>

<h2><a name="A_WONDERFUL_BALL" id="A_WONDERFUL_BALL">A WONDERFUL BALL</a></h2>

<p>I have heard of a wonderful ball which
floats in the sweet blue air, and has soft
white clouds about it as it floats along.</p>

<p>There are many charming stories to be
told about this wonderful ball. Some of
them you shall hear.</p>

<p>It is so large that many houses are built
upon it. Men and women live upon it, and
little children can play upon its surface.</p>

<p>In some places it is soft and green, like
the long meadows between the hills. In
other parts there are trees for miles and
miles on every side. All kinds of wild animals
live in the great forests that grow on
this wonderful ball.</p>

<p>Then again in some places it is steep and
rough. And there are mountains so high that
the snow lies upon their tops all the year
around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>In other parts there are no hills at all, but
level land, and quiet little ponds of blue
water. There the white water lilies grow
and fishes play among the lily stems.</p>

<p>Now, if we look on another side of the
ball, we shall see no ponds, but something very
dreary. A great plain of sand stretches away
on every side. There are no trees, and the
sunshine beats down upon the burning sand.</p>

<p>We look again, and we see a great body
of water. Many islands are in the sea, and
great ships sail upon it.</p>

<p>Look at one more side of this ball as it
turns around. Jack Frost must have spent
all his longest winter nights here. For see
what a palace of ice he has built for himself.</p>

<p>How cold it looks! See the clear, blue ice,
almost as blue as the sky. And look at the
snow, drifts upon drifts, and the feathery
flakes filling the air.</p>

<p>Now, what do you think of this ball, so
white and cold, so warm and green, so dreary
and rough, as it floats along in the sweet blue
air, with the flocks of white clouds about it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>I will tell you one thing more. The wise
men have said that this earth on which we
live is just such a ball. We shall know more
about this when we are older and wiser.</p>

<p>Down in the grass plot of a pretty garden
grew a little dandelion. He wore a green
jacket, and his head was covered
with sunny, yellow curls.</p>

<p>In the morning, he stood
up boldly, lifting his jolly little
face to catch the dewdrops.
In this way he took his morning
bath, and he found it very
refreshing. At dusk he put
on his green nightgown and
went to bed very early.</p>

<p>The mothers said, as they
called the children from their
play, "See, there is the good dandelion!
He knows when it is time to go to bed."</p>

<p>As the dandelion grew older, his yellow curls
turned white. Then the children would blow&mdash;one,
two, three times. If all the hairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
blew away, it was a sign that
mother wanted them at once.</p>

<p>If there were ten hairs left,
the children said, "Mother
wants us at ten o'clock." If
but two hairs remained, they
said, "Mother will look for
us at two o'clock."</p>

<p>When the children awoke
in the morning, they saw
the morning-glory cups peeping
in at the windows.
"Six o'clock! Time to get
up!" they said. "The
morning glories are calling
us."</p>

<p>Every afternoon the four-o'clocks bloomed.
Their red and white flowers told the children
that their father would soon be home.</p>

<p>In the evening the moon flowers unfolded
their great white blossoms on the vines that
clambered over the porch. "Now it is bedtime,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
said the children, "for the moon
flowers are looking down at us."</p>

<p>All day long the time flowers, like our
clocks, are telling us the time of day.</p>

<p>here was once a stalk of wheat
that grew in the middle of a
field. It was very tall and it
lifted its head high and nodded
in the wind.</p>

<p>All around it were a thousand
other stalks not quite so tall.
Every one was looking up at the
sun and bowing to its neighbor,
and saying, "Good morning."</p>

<p>"How bright and golden we
are!" said the tall stalk; "and
how beautiful we look, standing
together like a great army of soldiers!
The sun shines to cheer
us. And when the gentle rains
fall, how sweet and refreshing
they are!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" said the other stalks, waving
back and forth in the morning breeze. "All
the world is very kind to us. We have nothing
to do but to live and grow and become
bright and golden like the sun."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the tall stalk. "It is true that
we must live and grow and become yellow
and golden. But after that, there must be
something else for us to do."</p>

<p>The very next day the farmer came into
the fields to look at his wheat. He took
some of the bearded heads and rubbed them
between his hands. They were full of plump,
round, golden grains.</p>

<p>"What fine flour these will make, and
what good bread for little Alice," he said.
"The wheat is fully ripe and it must be cut
at once."</p>

<p>Then all the golden-headed stalks waved
back and forth in the wind. "Now we
understand it all," they whispered. "It is
for the sake of the farmer's fair little girl
that we are here.</p>

<p>"She must live and grow and be healthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and beautiful. There is nothing that can
help her to do this so well as good bread
made from the best of wheat."</p>

<p>Very soon the golden stalks were cut. The
wheat was threshed and ground into the finest
of flour. And then the flour was baked into
fresh, white loaves of bread.</p>

<p>But little Alice did not know that her bread
was made of the wheat that she had seen
growing in the big field where the daisies
bloomed.</p>

<p>The old apple
tree had stood
in the corner of
the pasture for so
many years that no
one could tell when
it was planted.</p>

<p>It was a friendly old tree.
Under its branches men and animals
found pleasant shade. In the
spring it gave blossoms to all that came, and
in the fall it dropped apples at their feet.</p>
<p>The apple tree was easy to climb, as Dick
well knew. From its top he could see the
sloping hillside and the little brook that
flowed through the pasture. Indeed, he
spent so much time playing in the old tree
that his father often said, "Well, Dick, has
the Apple-Tree Mother kept you out of mischief
to-day?"</p>

<p>And so Dick came to wonder a great deal
about the Apple-Tree Mother.</p>

<p>The time of green apples had come, and all
day long a hard wind had been blowing.
When supper time came Dick was ill. Perhaps
the apple tree could have told the reason.</p>

<p>Dick was lying on the couch, and his
mother was busy making a cup of tea for
him.</p>



<p>After he had taken the hot and bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
drink he lay watching the steam that rose
from the teakettle. Just as he was closing
his eyes in sleep the steam began to turn
from white to green. Then an apple tree
grew up out of the teakettle and stretched
its branches to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"That looks like the apple tree in the
corner of our pasture," thought Dick.</p>

<p>And then he saw a woman sitting in the
midst of the branches. She wore a dress
that was green and brown, like the apple-tree
leaves in the fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose that is the Apple-Tree Mother,"
said Dick to himself. "If she is as old as
our tree, she must be very old indeed."</p>

<p>Then the Apple-Tree Mother laughed and
all the leaves of the tree danced. "My little
boy," she said, "I am so old that I have
grown young again, and I bring with me
pictures and stories of the world that has
lived about my tree."</p>
</div>
<p>"Pictures and stories!" exclaimed Dick.
"Oh, can't you show me some of them?"</p>

<p>"That is just why I came to visit you,"
she said. "Will you have pictures of animals
or of flowers?"</p>

<p>"I would like to see pictures of animals
first," said Dick.</p>

<p>Then the room changed to the corner of the
pasture. There was the fence and the brook
and the old apple tree. Just above the fence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
half hidden in the branches, was a nest that
held five tiny eggs.</p>

   <img src="images/p0034-illus.png" alt="The Oriole's Nest." title="The Oriole's Nest." />
   <p class="caption2">The Oriole's Nest.</p>
</div>

<p>The sound of bird voices was heard, and there
in the tree Dick saw two orioles. They were
singing a song together,
and somehow Dick could understand
it all. They
sang of their little
home and of the eggs
that lay within it.
And they sang of
the happy time when
five little birds would
come to be loved
and cared for.</p>

<p>Then the two orioles rose slowly into the
air and flew across the field. The nest was
left alone.</p>

<p>Down the road came a boy whistling and
kicking up the dust with every step.</p>

<p>Dick began to feel very unhappy, for he
knew just what would happen next.</p>

<p>The boy in the picture looked up and saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the brown nest among the leaves. "There
is an oriole's nest," thought he. And in a
moment he had climbed the tree, and the five
tiny eggs were in his hand.</p>

<p>"I'll take them home," he said, as he put
the eggs into his pocket. But he handled
them so roughly that three were broken.</p>

<p>With an angry word he threw all the eggs
on the ground, and then went on whistling
and kicking up the dust.</p>

<p>A joyous bird song was heard in the air,
and the two orioles darted into the apple
tree. The mother bird flew to her nest.
Then she gave a cry so sharp and sad that
it hurt one's heart to hear it.</p>

<p>The father bird joined the poor mother in
her outcries of fright and sorrow. There on
the dusty ground lay all that was left of the
beautiful eggs.</p>

<p>Far across the field flew the oriole mother,
almost wild with sorrow. The father, with
his feathers drooping, sat on a fence post,
and his happy songs were changed to notes
of sadness.</p>

<p>The Apple-Tree Mother looked very grave,
but she only said, "Shall we have another
picture?"</p>

<p>Dick was afraid to say "No." He lay
quite still, looking at the apple tree. The
rain was beginning to beat against the
leaves. Then he saw a weary little dog come
limping to the tree, whining, and licking
one of his paws.</p>

<p>He was not a handsome dog. His legs
were crooked and one ear was torn. The
branches of the tree bent above him. And
when the poor dog looked up at their shelter,
one could see how big and soft and sad were
his eyes.</p>

<p>With a splashing noise two boys came
wading across the brook. Each boy had a
fishing pole over his shoulder, and in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
hand was a small tin pail in which he had
carried bait.</p>

<p>As they came toward the tree one of them
pointed to the poor little dog. It was the
same boy that had stolen the oriole's eggs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="p0037-illus.png" id="p0037-illus.png"></a>
   <img src="images/p0037-illus.png" alt="Two boys with fishing poles walking in a creek" title="Two boys with fishing poles walking in a creek" />
</div>

<p>"Now for some fun!" he said. Then both
the boys sat down on the ground, and to
work they went with a fishing line and one
of the empty pails.</p>

<p>They did not see how the apple tree shook
its head at them. They did not hear how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
each raindrop called, "No! no! no!" as it
fell pattering on the leaves.</p>

<p>The poor little dog lay resting under the
tree, safe from the storm. All at once he
was caught and held by rough hands. He
howled with fright and pain, but he could not
get away. A strong cord was bound around
his thin little body, and his wounded foot
was sadly hurt.</p>

<p>At last the boys let him go, and with a
wild bound he jumped through the fence and
ran along the road.</p>

<p>But oh, what terrible thing is rattling and
banging around him? At every leap he is
cruelly struck on his crooked little legs.</p>

<p>Dick had turned his head the other way.
His cheeks burned and his heart was sad.
Then he opened his eyes and saw his mother
standing beside him with a second cup of
bitter tea in her hand.</p>

<p>"Such a nice sleep as you have had," she
said. "I really think you are better. Now
sit up and drink this like a man."</p>

<p>Never a word said Dick. He sat up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
drank the bitter tea, while he thought of
many things. Had he seen himself in the
pictures which the Apple-Tree Mother had
brought to his bedside?</p>

<p>Once upon a time it was very hot and
very, very dry. No rain had fallen for days
and days. The thirsty birds had stopped
singing. The plants withered and the animals
were dying for want of water. All the
people were praying for rain.</p>

<p>One morning a little girl started out to find
some water for her sick mother. In her hand
she carried a tin dipper.</p>

<p>She climbed a high hill hoping to find a
spring. Up and up she climbed. On her
way she saw the dusty plants, the quiet
birds, and the suffering animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The sharp stones cut her feet. High rocks
towered above her head. Their strange
shapes filled her with fear. But she thought
of her sick mother and she would not turn
back. At last she came to a great wall of
rocks, and could go no farther.</p>

<p>"Oh, that some good fairy would show me
where to find water!" she cried.</p>

<p>And then a beautiful fairy stood before her
in a robe like the clouds at sunset. She
pointed to a narrow path among the rocks.
The child followed the path and soon came to
a spring hidden under green fern leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>She filled her dipper to the brim. How
carefully she held it! How softly she
stepped, so as not to spill one drop!</p>

<p>In her path down the hill there lay a
rabbit almost dead from thirst. The little
girl needed all the water, but she poured a
few drops upon the rabbit's tongue. Then
something wonderful happened! The rusty
tin dipper was changed to shining silver.</p>

<p>The little girl hurried home. With a
happy heart she gave the water to her sick
mother. The gentle mother raised the dipper
to her lips, but she did not drink. "My
faithful nurse, let her drink first," she said.</p>

<p>As she gave the silver dipper to the nurse,
behold! it was changed to yellow gold.</p>

<p>Again the mother raised the water to her
lips. Just then a shadow fell across the
floor. In the open doorway stood an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
woman. She was ragged and pale and
weak. She could only stretch out her thin
hand toward the water.</p>

<p>The mother and the little girl looked at
each other. Could they give up the last drop
of the precious water? The mother nodded
her head, and the little girl put the golden
dipper into the hands of the stranger.</p>

<p>The poor old woman took the water and
drank it all. As she drank, her rags were
changed into beautiful garments, and the
dipper sparkled with diamonds.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, look! There is the fairy I saw
in the mountains," cried the little girl. "And
see! The dipper shines like diamonds!"</p>

<p>They looked again, but the fairy was gone.
It was not long before clouds spread over the
sky, and a gentle rain began to fall. Soon
there was water for all the plants, the birds,
the animals, and the people.</p>

<p>But the dipper could not anywhere be
found. Night came, and the little girl looked
up at the stars. There, in the sky, she saw
the dipper shining like diamonds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>And now, when the evening stars twinkle
overhead, the mothers point out the great
dipper in the northern sky and tell this story
to their children.</p>

<p>"Is the story true?" the children ask
when the tale is ended.</p>

<p>And the mothers smile as they answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When you can tell what the story means,
you will know that it is true."</p>

</div>

<p>Did you ever take a feather in
your hand and look at it? Did
you notice how the quill keeps
the feather in shape and makes
it strong?</p>

<p>Now find the leaf of an apple
tree. Hold it before your eyes and
let the light shine through it.</p>

<p>Do you see the large rib running
along the middle of the leaf? Do you
see the fine ribs on each side of the large
rib? Does not the large rib make you think
of the quill of a feather?</p>

<p>The ribs of a leaf have fine passages or
pipes in them through which the sap flows.
These passages are called veins, and the large
rib is called a midvein. When a leaf has
one strong midvein like the quill of a feather,
it is said to be feather-veined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us go out of doors and find leaves that
are shaped like feathers.</p>

<p>There is a peach tree. Pick a leaf and
look at it. Yes, the peach leaf is feather-veined.
Now go to the pear tree. "These
leaves look like the apple leaves," you say.</p>

<p>Here is a dandelion plant growing in the
grass. Take a leaf in your hand and look at
its ragged edges. There is one straight rib
or vein along the middle of the leaf. And so
you see that the dandelion leaf is also feather-veined.</p>

   <img src="images/p0053-illus.png" alt="Leaves on a branch" title="Leaves on a branch" />
</div>


<p>You can find feather-veined leaves on the
plants in the garden and on the flower stems
that grow in our window boxes. And you
can also find feather-veined leaves on the
weeds that grow by the side of the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Look again at the apple leaf. Do you see
the fine network of veins? Now take up a
leaf of grass and hold it in the light. Can
you see a network of veins in it? No, the
grass leaf has straight veins.</p>

<p>All the grass blades are long and narrow.
Have you ever seen any other leaves that were
long and narrow like
the grass?</p>

</div>

<p>But what is this
leaf under the maple
tree? "It is a maple
leaf," you say. This
leaf is not shaped
like a feather.</p>

<p>Hold out your hand and stretch out your
fingers. Does not the maple leaf look as if it
had fingers, too? We may call the maple
leaf a hand-shaped leaf. Perhaps we can
find more hand-shaped leaves. Let us go to
the currant bushes. Yes, these also have
hand-shaped leaves.</p>

<p>One of the strangest leaves in the world is
shaped like a pitcher. It has a lid that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
opens and shuts. Some leaves of this kind
hold more than a cup of water.</p>

<p>There are leaves shaped like hearts and
leaves shaped like arrowheads. And there
are many other wonderful leaves which we
may see if we keep our eyes open.</p>

<h2>DOGS THAT ALMOST TALK</h2>

<p>It seems as if our friend the dog can talk
without using words. He not only makes
other dogs understand him, but he also
makes his wants known to his master.</p>

<p>A little dog named Rudy was once taken
to the city. One day he lost his way in the
streets and did not come home at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, as Rudy's master was
looking out of the window, he saw his little
dog coming along the street with two other
dogs.</p>

<p>The strangers left Rudy at his own door,
and then went away. As they left they
seemed to say, "Good-by." But how did
Rudy ask the other dogs to show him the
way home? This we should like to know.</p>

<p>Another dog called Prince often asked in
his own way to be let out of doors. But
when he returned he could not always get
into the house again.</p>

<p>The bell was too high for Prince to reach
it or he might have learned to ring it. As
he could not do this he found another way to
get in. A little girl who lived near by often
played with him. He ran to her and begged
until she saw what he wanted. This he did
day after day.</p>

<p>After the little girl had rung the bell for
him, Prince never forgot to thank her. He
jumped around her and wagged his tail to
show his pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>One day Prince could not find his little
friend. So he begged a man who was passing
by to ring the bell. It was some time
before the man could understand what the
dog wanted. But at last the bell tinkled,
the door was opened, and Prince ran into
the house.</p>

<p>A faithful dog never forgets those he loves.
Sometimes he proves to be a good friend in
time of great need.</p>

<p>One night a fire broke out in a shed close
by a little cottage. The watchdog saw the
flames. He ran to the cottage and began to
scratch the door with his paws. He scratched
and howled until he woke the family.</p>

<p>After the fire had been put out the children
put their arms around the faithful dog.
They patted him and thanked him for saving
their lives. They treated him as if he were
a human being instead of only a dog.</p>

<p>There are many true stories about dogs
that have saved the lives of children. A
great artist has painted a beautiful picture
of one of these noble animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>A dog has jumped into the sea and saved
a child from drowning. He has caught the
child's clothes in his strong jaws, and has
brought her to the shore.</p>

<p>See, he is almost too tired to climb up
beside her! There she lies on his big paws.
He seems to be waiting for help. Does he
not look as if he could speak?</p>

</div>

<p>The artist who painted this picture was a
great friend of dogs. His name was Edwin
Landseer. He has made hundreds of paintings
of his humble friends. Many of the dogs
in his pictures look as if they could talk.</p>

<p>Just as they came
near George's home
they saw before them
a little boy much
smaller than Rollo. He
was ragged and barefooted.</p>

<p>"There is Tom," said
George. "See how I will frighten him."</p>

<p>As he said this, George rolled his wheelbarrow
directly toward Tom as if he were
going to run over him. Tom was very much
frightened and began to scream.</p>

<p>Just at that moment Farmer Cropwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
happened to be coming up the lane on the
opposite side of the road. He called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"George!"</p>

<p>George stopped his wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>"Is that right?" said the farmer.</p>

<p>"Why, I was not going to hurt him," said
George.</p>

<p>"You did hurt him,&mdash;you frightened
him."</p>

<p>"Is frightening him hurting him, father?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; it is giving pain, and a very
unpleasant kind of pain, too."</p>

<p>"I did not think of that," said George.</p>

<p>"Besides," said his father, "when you
treat boys in that harsh, rough way you
make them your enemies. And it is a very
bad plan to make enemies."</p>

<p>"Enemies, father!" said George, laughing;
"Tom could not do me any harm if he were
my enemy."</p>

<p>"That makes me think of the story of the
bear and the tomtit," said the farmer. "If
you and Rollo will jump into the cart I will
tell it to you."</p>

<p>One pleasant summer morning a wolf met
a bear in a lonely wood. In a tree near by,
a bird was singing.</p>

<p>"Brother," said the bear, "that is very
good singing, indeed. What kind of bird do
you think it is?"</p>

<p>"That is a tomtit," said the wolf.</p>

<p>"I should like to see his nest. Where do
you think it is?" asked the bear.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall see if we wait until his
mate comes home," said the wolf.</p>

<p>Soon the mother bird came flying with
some food in her mouth for her children. She
went to the tree where her mate was singing.</p>

<p>"Now, I shall climb the tree," said the bear.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said the wolf. "Wait until the
birds leave the nest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>They walked away for some distance, but
soon returned, for the bear was impatient to
see the nest. He scrambled up the tree, intending
to frighten the young birds.</p>

<p>"Take care," said the wolf. "The tomtits
are very little, but little enemies are sometimes
very troublesome."</p>

<p>"Who is afraid of a tomtit?" said the bear,
as he poked his black nose into the nest.</p>

<p>"Go away! go away!" screamed the poor
little birds in terror.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by making such a
noise and talking so to me?" said the bear.
"I will teach you better manners."</p>

<p>So he put his great paw on the nest and
pressed it down until the poor little birds
could hardly breathe. Then he left them and
went away.</p>

<p>The young tomtits were terribly frightened,
and some of them were hurt. When the old
birds came home they were very angry.</p>

<p>They could see the bear walking about
among the trees, but they did not know how
to punish him.</p>

<p>Not far away there was a glen, surrounded
by high rocks, where the bear used to go to
sleep because it was a lonely place.</p>

<p>One day, as he was prowling in the woods,
he saw two hunters coming with their guns.
In fright, he fled to his glen, where he thought
he should be safe.</p>

<p>The tomtits saw the bear run to the rocks
and hide in terror.</p>

<p>"Why is the bear hiding?" said one bird
to the other.</p>

<p>"Do you see those hunters with their
guns?" said the mother tomtit. "If only
they can find the bear, then our little ones
will be safe. Let us help them."</p>

<p>So the tomtits began to flutter around the
hunters and fly a little way toward the glen
and then back again. The men followed the
birds to see what could be the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>By and by the bear saw the hunters coming,
led on by his little enemies, the tomtits.
He ran from one side of the glen to the other.
He hid himself in a cave among the rocks.
But he could not escape the hunters.</p>

<p>The wolf happened to be near by upon the
rocks that overlooked the glen. Hearing the
noise, he came and peeped over.</p>

<p>As soon as he saw what had happened to
the bear, he thought it would be prudent for
him to walk away. This he did, saying to
himself as he went:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, the bear has found out that a friend
is better than an enemy, whether he is great
or small."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here the farmer paused. He had ended
his story.</p>

<p>"What did they do with the bear?" asked
Rollo.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the farmer, "they took off his
skin to make caps of, and nailed his claws
up on the barn."</p>

<p>A dog, with a piece of meat in his mouth,
was hurrying home to eat his supper in quiet.
On his way he had to pass over a narrow
plank which lay across a small stream.</p>

<p>As he looked down into the water he saw
his own image in the smooth surface of the
brook. This, he thought, was another dog
with a larger piece of meat in his mouth.</p>

<p>He put his head down near the water.
Behold, the meat, which the other dog carried,
was plainly within his reach.</p>

<p>"Now, I shall have a fine dinner," he
thought. And with a quick snap of his jaws,
he tried to snatch the meat from the dog in
the water.</p>

<p>But as he opened his mouth, his own piece
of meat fell to the bottom of the brook. And
thus, by greed, he lost all that he had.</p>

<p>An Indian boy sees many things which a
white boy passes by without seeing. Can
you tell why?</p>

<p>The Indian boy is taught to look at things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
closely, and to think about everything he sees.
He learns to observe. Here is a good story
of an Indian who was trained to use his eyes
when he was young.</p>

<p>An old Indian once lived in a village
among white people. His little hut was
near the woods. A white man lived alone
in a cabin near by.</p>

<p>One night the white man came home late
from his work in the fields. He had left
a bag of corn hanging in his cabin. Some
one had taken it.</p>

<p>He was very angry. "That lazy Indian
who lives in the hut has stolen my corn," he
told his neighbors.</p>

<p>"Send for the Indian and let him speak
for himself," said one of the neighbors.</p>

<p>When the Indian came he said, "I did not
take your corn."</p>

<p>"If you did not take my corn, who did?"
asked the angry man.</p>

<p>"I can not tell you his name," the Indian
answered. "I have never seen him, but
I can tell you something about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your corn was stolen by a white man.
He is an old man, and he is a short man."</p>

<p>One of the neighbors had seen a little old
man. He was going to the woods with a
bag on his back.</p>

<p>They went out to hunt for him. Soon he
was found, and the bag of corn was returned
to its owner.</p>

<p>How could the Indian tell who had taken
the corn? Every one wanted to know.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," said the Indian. "I
knew that the thief was an old man from
the heavy mark of his feet in the earth.
A young man's step is much lighter.</p>

<p>"I knew he was a white man because he
turned his toes out when he walked. An
Indian does not walk in that way.</p>

<p>"Did you not see that he stood on a
stool to reach the bag of corn? This shows
that he was a short man."</p>

<p>"Now see," said the neighbors. "If you
had kept your eyes open as the Indian keeps
his open, you would not have said that he
stole your corn."</p>

<p>One summer morning, a merry group of
children was helping to make hay in one of
the Clovernook
hay
fields.</p>

<div class="figright" >

</div>

<p>Not far
away stood a
little brown
house in the
cool shade of
cherry trees
and apple trees. A sweetbrier clambered
over the windows, and in the dooryard grew
bushes of large red roses.</p>

<p>Near the house was a deep well of clear, cold
water. An old-fashioned well sweep was used
to draw up the water, as you see in the picture.</p>

<p>This was the Clovernook home. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
lived the merry children who were helping
in the hayfield, and there were nine of them.
What if the house was small? There was
the barn in which they could play, and there
were the fields and woods in which they
could wander.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <p class="caption2">"He liked to gather his children around him."</p>
</div>

<p>They thought their gentle, blue-eyed mother
the most beautiful woman in the world. Their
father was one of the kindest of men. Every
child loved him, and the horses and the cows
followed him all over the farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>He loved books, and went about his work
repeating fine old hymns and lines from grand
poems. In the long winter evenings he liked
to gather his children around him before the
open fire. Then he told them wonderful
stories of the olden time.</p>

<p>The Clovernook children learned to know
the flowers and the trees by name, and to
tell the birds by their songs. In the spring
they boiled sap for maple sugar. In the
fall they gathered nuts, and helped store
away the apples in the cellar.</p>

<p>There were two daughters of the Clovernook
household who liked nothing so well as their
books. They went to school when their mother
could spare them from the work of the home.
At night they often wished to study, but they
had no lamp. So they put some lard into a
saucer and used a piece of cloth for a wick.</p>

<p>Year after year these two girls spent all
their spare moments in reading and study.
What they did when they were older, and
how they came to be called the Poet Sisters,
you shall soon learn.</p>

<p>The Clovernook
cottage was the
home of the Cary
family, and the
Poet Sisters were
Alice Cary and
Ph&#339;be Cary.</p>

<p>While the sisters
were still little
girls, they began
to write verses.
Ph&#339;be was but
fourteen years old
when she sent her first poem to a newspaper.
She told no one, not even her sister Alice,
what she had done.</p>

<p>At last her father brought the paper from
the postoffice. When Ph&#339;be saw her poem
in print she was so happy that she laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and cried. After that, she did not care if her
clothes were plain, or if she could not go to
school as much as she wished.</p>

<p>The Clovernook home was near Cincinnati,
Ohio. When Alice and Ph&#339;be grew older
they left the home of their childhood and
went to live in New
York city.</p>

<p>They were now
able to earn money
by writing stories and
poems for books and
papers. At last they
could make their
home beautiful with
the books and pictures
which they had
so long wished for.</p>

<p>Alice and Ph&#339;be
loved children, and they wrote many beautiful
verses for their little friends. In their
charming stories they tell us about their life
in Clovernook, and of their plays in hayfield
and barn.</p>

</div>

<p>When Columbus reached the New World,
he landed on a beautiful green island. He
tells us that the island was covered with
trees like an orchard. The trees and the
flowers and the fruits were different from any
that he had ever seen before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>All day he remained on shore with his
men. They were delighted with the warm
air, the clear streams, the bright flowers, and
the fresh fruit.</p>

<p>The natives were friendly and gentle.
They wore no clothes, but their bodies were
painted with many colors. They came near
the strangers and seemed to wonder at their
white faces.</p>

<p>Some of the natives wore rings of gold in
their noses and ears. Columbus tried to
learn from them where they had found the
gold. They pointed to the south and said
"Cuba." By signs they led him to believe
that Cuba was a land where there was much
gold.</p>

<p>Columbus was in haste to reach the mines
of gold and the rich cities about which he
had read. The next day he sailed with all
his ships and sailors toward the south.</p>

<p>They passed by many green islands as beautiful
as the one on which they had landed.
Columbus sat on deck, watching the shore.
He hoped and he believed that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
soon see the towers of a city rise toward
the sky.</p>

<p>The news of the visit of the white men
spread from island to island. The natives
ran to the shore to see the wonderful ships
with sails like white wings. They paddled
out to the ships in their canoes, and they
brought fruit and balls of cotton yarn.</p>

<p>Columbus and his men were looking everywhere
for gold. Whenever they saw a village
of huts they visited the chief and asked him
where gold could be found. They traded bells
and beads for the gold ornaments which the
natives wore.</p>

<p>Soon Columbus reached the shores of Cuba.
Everywhere he saw beautiful flowers and
fruits. He found gentle natives living in
poor huts. But he saw no cities and he
found no mines of gold.</p>

<p>Columbus supposed that he had reached
some small islands on the coast of India.
For this reason he called the dark-skinned
people living there Indians. He did not
know that he had found the New World.</p>

<p>At last Columbus gave up the search for
gold, and decided to return to Spain. He
wished to tell King Ferdinand and Queen
Isabella of the islands he had visited.</p>

<p>He was sure that he had discovered a new
way to India, and he wished to ask the king
for more ships and more men. He believed
that great riches could be found on these
islands which he had visited.</p>

<p>Early in January he gave a farewell feast
to the natives. Then he sailed for Spain,
taking with him six Indians.</p>

<p>His flagship, the <i>Santa Maria</i>, had been
wrecked. One of his captains had sailed
away in the <i>Pinta</i> and had not returned.
And so Columbus was obliged to cross the
ocean in the <i>Nina</i>, which was the smallest of
his three ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>The voyage was long and the storms were
many. The little ship was tossed about by
the waves and was often in great danger.
But at last the shores of Spain were seen by
the sailors, and great was their joy.</p>

<p>At noon, on the fifteenth of March, 1493,
they sailed into the harbor which they had
left more than seven months before. All
the people in the town crowded to the shore.
For a long time they had thought that Columbus
was lost at sea, and that they would never
see him and his sailors again.</p>

<p>The first act of Columbus was to lead his
men to the church, where they gave thanks
to God for their safe return.</p>

<p>Very soon the good news spread over all
Spain. Bells were rung, and great fires were
lighted on the hilltops.</p>

<p>King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella were
several hundred miles from the seaport town
where Columbus landed with his sailors. As
soon as the king and queen heard of his safe
return, they sent Columbus a letter asking
him to come without delay to their court.</p>

<p>The time of year was delightful for the
long journey through Spain. Every mile of
the way Columbus and his men received a
welcome. As they passed along the plains
and over the mountains, men, women, and
children came to see the brave sailors who
had dared to cross the ocean.</p>

<p>When they reached the end of their journey,
they were met by officers of the king.
Then all marched into the city through
crowded streets where banners were flying.</p>

<p>First came Columbus riding a fine horse.
Next walked six Indians, painted and wearing
feathers in their hair.</p>

<p>The sailors followed, carrying strange birds
and animals from across the sea. Some had
live parrots which they had caught and tamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>One man carried a turtle shell almost as
large as himself. Others showed with great
pride the curious rings and crowns of gold
which they had brought from the islands.</p>

<p>The king and queen sat on their throne
awaiting Columbus. When he came near,
they rose to greet him, and they asked him
to take a seat by their side.</p>

<p>In the great room were the lords and ladies
of the court and the chief men of the kingdom.
Every one looked with wonder at the
painted Indians and at the strange gifts which
were carried by the sailors.</p>

<p>Columbus then gave an account of his
wonderful voyage. When his story was done,
the king and queen knelt in thanks to
God. Then the great crowd of people joined
them in thanksgiving and in a grand song
of praise.</p>

<p>So great was the honor paid to Columbus
that he rode with the king and his son
through the streets of the city. The people
thronged to see him, and they called him the
third king.</p>

<p>Almost a year had passed since the first
company of Pilgrims had come to America.
About fifty of those who had crossed the
ocean in the Mayflower were now living in
their new home.</p>

<p>They had laid out a village street and had
built a few houses in the place which they
called Plymouth. Their houses were made
of logs. The roofs were very steep and were
covered with grass and rushes.</p>

<p>It had been a busy summer for the Pilgrims.
They had worked hard in the gardens
and the fields. But the harvests were good
and there would be food enough for the coming
winter. How thankful they were!</p>

<p>"Let us set aside a day in which to give
thanks for this great harvest," they said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
"It is God who has sent the sunshine and
the rain to make the seeds grow. We will
have a day of thanksgiving, and ask the
friendly Indians to come and rejoice with
us."</p>

<p>So the Indian chief and his band were
invited to the feast. Such a busy time as
that was for the Pilgrims! The men went
to the forest to hunt deer, wild turkeys,
and other game. All the women were at
work, and the smoke of the ovens rose from
the chimneys.</p>

<p>Even the children helped. Some of them
gathered the cranberries that were turning
red in the lowlands. Some picked the wild
grapes that were growing purple on the vines.
Others brought home the nuts which were
falling from the trees. The older boys were
sent to the beach for clams.</p>

<p>The Indians were invited to come on
Thursday. At sunrise on that day the
Pilgrims were awakened by whoops and
yells which told them that their guests had
already arrived.</p>

<p>It was in the month of November, but the
weather was mild and lovely, and a soft blue
haze seemed to veil the woods.</p>

<p>Late wild flowers were blooming. Bright
leaves were falling from the trees. It was the
time of year that we call Indian summer.</p>

<p>A great fire was built out of doors for the
cooking, and long tables were spread in the
open air. When the loud roll of the drum
was heard, all the people went to the log
fort on the hill which was used as a meeting
house. There they gave thanks to God for
the rich harvest of the year.</p>

<p>Everybody, young and old, was there. The
little children must have grown very tired
of the long sermon. They must have wanted
to go home to the good dinner which they
knew was waiting for them.</p>

<p>At last the Thanksgiving feast was ready.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
In the middle of the long table stood a
huge bowl of stew made of different kinds
of game.</p>

   <img src="images/p0093-illus.png" alt="Pilgrims and Indians at Thanksgiving feast" title="Pilgrims and Indians at Thanksgiving feast" />
</div>

<p>There were great roasts of deer and roasted
turkeys stuffed with nuts. There were the
cakes and puddings made by the Pilgrim
mothers. And it is said that the Indians
brought a large basket of popcorn which they
poured on the table just as the meal began.</p>

<p>In this way the Pilgrims passed their first
Thanksgiving Day in America.</p>

<p>Hundreds and hundreds
of miles away in the white
frozen north, there is a wonderful
land of snow and
ice. There strange little yellow
people, called Eskimos, live in
snow houses, and dress in the skins of animals.</p>

<p>In summer, in this wonderful land, the sun
never sets, but shines all the time, day and
night. Flowers spring up, and soft-eyed reindeer
wander about cropping the short grass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>The ice breaks up and drifts out to sea.
Great rivers of ice push forward into the
water. Enormous icebergs break off from
them and float away like white ships.</p>

<p>The blue waves dance and sparkle in the
sun. Singing brooks rush down the mountains.
Thousands of noisy sea birds come
to the rocky cliffs to lay their eggs.</p>
</div>
<p>Glossy seals swim in the water, and once
in a while a shaggy white bear goes running
over the floating ice in search of seals.</p>

<p>The Eskimos, paddling swiftly through the
water in their strange skin boats, hunt these
animals for food and clothing.</p>

<p>In winter there is no sunshine at all in
Eskimo land. For four long, long months
it is dark all the time, just as it is here in
the night. The ground is covered deep with
snow, and the poor deer must dig through
it with their hoofs for grass and moss.</p>

<p>The sea is covered thick with ice, and the
birds fly away. The cold is so terrible that
the Eskimos would freeze to death were it
not for their thick, warm fur coats.</p>

<p>Here in this wonderful land there was
found, one September day, a snow-white baby
with big blue
eyes.</p>

<p>And such a
funny little house
it was where she
was found. It was
only one story
high. The walls
were more than a
foot thick, and the
outside was covered
with heavy
black paper. All
around the house
was a veranda. Its walls were built of boxes
of biscuit, sugar, coffee, and tea.</p>

<p>Inside the house, the little room where
the baby lived was lined with soft warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
blankets. There was a bright carpet on the
floor and pictures on the walls.</p>

<p>All these things, like the boxes of food outside,
came in the ship which brought the baby's
father and mother to this strange country.</p>

<p>One window of the baby's room looked out
upon a great river of ice. From the other
window you could see high red and brown
mountains. And here was the sea in which
strange-looking icebergs floated.</p>

<p>When the people of that land heard that
there was a white baby in the small black
house, they came hundreds of miles to see
the little stranger.</p>

<p>They talked to the baby in their own queer
language. They called her the Snow Baby,
and they brought her presents of fur mittens
and little sealskin boots.</p>

<p>After the sun went away the baby lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
for days and weeks in a little room lined with
blankets. A lamp was kept burning in the
room all the time, both day and night.</p>

<p>One of the Eskimo women made a little suit
of clothes for the baby, all out of furs. There
were only two pieces in this suit. First there
was a pair of little trousers and boots made
together. Over this a hooded coat was worn.</p>

<p>When the sun returned, the Snow Baby was
taken out of doors every day. No matter
how cold it was she had a sleigh ride on her
little Eskimo sledge. You should have seen
her team of dogs with their bright eyes, their
sharp-pointed ears, and their big bushy tails.</p>

<p>For nearly a year the Snow Baby lived in
this strange, northern home. But one day in
August a big black ship came up the bay.
It was the same ship that had brought the
Snow Baby's father and mother to the Snowland.</p>

<p>Then the baby and her mother went on
board the ship and steamed away south to
their own American home.</p>

<p>In the summer time the Eskimo people
live in tents made of skins. In the winter

<p>Perhaps you would like to visit an Eskimo
family, and see how these yellow people live
in a snow house. But how shall we get into
the house? There seems to be no door in
this strange-looking mound of snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>We must bow our heads and crawl on our
hands and knees through a dark passage.
Soon we come to an open space where we
stand upright in a dimly lighted room.</p>

<p>All around the room is a bank of snow
next to the wall of the house. The top of
this bank is broad and level like a table. It
is covered with the thick skins of reindeer,
bear, and foxes. Here the family eat and
sleep, and here the children play.</p>

<p>Near the doorway stands the stove, on a
raised platform. You would think it a very
poor stove, for it is only a hollow stone filled
with oil and moss. When the moss is lighted,
it burns like the wick of a lamp.</p>

<p>This stove warms the room, melts the
water for drinking, dries wet clothing, and
thaws the frozen meat. It lights the room
dimly and we see the Eskimo father, mother,
and children in their snow house.</p>

<p>A bag is lying on the thick furs. Now it
moves and the mother takes it in her arms.
See, it is a baby boy in a bag of feathers.</p>

<p>When an Eskimo baby is in the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
he lies in his feather bag. And when he is
out of doors, he is always on his mother's
back, inside of her fur hood.</p>

<p>As soon as an Eskimo boy is old enough to
walk, he has a puppy for a playmate. He
learns to harness his dog and drive it all
around the room. Soon he will be able to
drive a team of dogs, as his father does, and
ride swiftly over the snow.</p>

</div>

<p>The large boys catch fish and hunt seal.
They even help to kill great whales and fierce
white bears.</p>

<p>But what does the little Eskimo girl do?
The little sister learns to sew and to make
clothes out of skins. She makes her own
needle from a hard bone or a piece of iron,
and she twists thread from strips of deerskin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Everything the Eskimos use they make with
their own hands.</p>

<p>Sometimes our ships force their way through
the frozen ocean to their land of ice and
snow. The Eskimo people think these great
ships the most wonderful things they have
ever seen.</p>

<p>Cut an apple into halves and take out
one of the little brown seeds. How small
it is! Now look at an apple tree. Did
the apple tree come
out of a little brown
seed like the one you
hold in your hand?</p>

<div class="figright" >
   <a name="p0111-illus.png" id="p0111-illus.png"></a>
   <img src="images/p0111-illus.png" alt="An apple sliced in half" title="An apple sliced in half" />
</div>


<p>You say that it did. Look again. Which
is larger, the seed or the apple tree? And
now you laugh, as you say: "Of course an
apple tree is larger than an apple seed."
Then there must be something in the apple
tree that was not in the seed.</p>

<p>The tree has a trunk or stem. It has
leaves and it has roots. How were all
these made?</p>

<p>Do you say that the apple tree grew? But
what do you mean by growing? Something
must have come into the apple seed to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
it grow into a plant. And something must
have come into the little green apple plant
to make it grow into a tree.</p>

<p>What was it? Where did the plant get it?
Cut into a green stem of the apple tree.
See how the juice runs out!</p>

<p>The apple tree was made from this juice
which we call sap. This sap is the blood
of the plant. It makes the plant grow just
as your blood makes you grow.</p>

<p>The sap came to the little apple plant all
the time it was growing. But where did the
plant get the sap?</p>

<p>The food of a plant lies all about its roots.
The rain, or water from your watering pot,
falls around the plant. It sinks into the
ground. Then the water dissolves the earth
just as it dissolves sugar.</p>

<p>The seed swells, and the brown seed coat
bursts. Then a little root runs down into
the earth. This root has hundreds of openings
or mouths. The little openings are so
small that our eyes can not see them.</p>

<p>The roots suck in the water from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
ground. The earth that is dissolved in the
water creeps up into the plant. This juice
or sap makes the plant grow.</p>

<p>But the plant must have air as well as
food. The sap can not turn into wood and
bark and fruit until it has met the air. So
the sap flows up into the leaves and meets
the air.</p>

<div id="i0113">
<div id="i011301">&nbsp;</div>
<div id="i011302">&nbsp;</div>
<div id="i011303">&nbsp;</div>
<div id="i011304">&nbsp;</div>
<div id="i011305"><p class="caption">Apple Blossoms.</p></div>

<p>Then it finds its way into every part of the
plant. It changes into the rough bark and
hard wood of the apple tree. It
changes into pink apple blossoms
and buds. It
changes into red
apples and yellow
apples. The same
sap makes sweet apples
and sour apples. Every
part of a plant is made from
sap. Is not that very strange?</p>

<p>We have learned that the roots take the
food of plants from the earth. They do more
than this. The roots are the feet of the
plant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>You could not stand without your feet.
You would fall on the ground or the floor.
And so the tree or the plant could not stand
without its roots.</p>

<p>Other plants grow just as the apple tree
grows. The roots of a plant get food from
the earth and keep the plant in its place in
the ground. The stem makes the plant
strong and holds it up in the air. And the
leaves draw in just what the plants need
from the air around them.</p>

<p>"What a long, long day!" said Fannie.
"Rain, rain all the time, and nothing pleasant
to do. I wish mother
would let me go out
of doors and play in
the water.</p>

<div class="figleft" >

</div>

<p>"The ducks seem
to be having a fine
time on the pond.
They like the rain.
If I only had a coat of feathers, I shouldn't
mind a little wetting. I could dive and
splash about all day long. But now I suppose
I must go to sleep, for there seems to be
nothing else for me to do."</p>

<p>So Fannie threw herself on her bed. She
lay with her eyes half open, watching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
raindrops as they trickled down the window
panes.</p>

<p>Flap, flap, flap! "What is that at the
window?" Flap, flap, flap! In flew a dozen
geese. "Quack, quack! quack! Who carried
off our feathers?" they were screaming.
They flew around the room, beating their
wings against the walls and ceiling.</p>

<p>Flap, flap, flap! went the flock of geese
over Fannie's head, and down they pounced
upon the pillow. In a few minutes it was
torn to pieces, and the feathers scattered all
over the floor.</p>

<p>"Quack, quack, quack! Here are our
feathers!" cried all the geese; and each one
seized a bunch of feathers in its bill. Then
they flew off, leaving the air full of soft,
white down.</p>

<p>Patter, patter, patter! The door was
gently pushed open, and there stood a sheep.
"Please walk in, madam," said Fannie; and
in came a whole flock of sheep.</p>

<p>"Baa, baa, baa! Where is the wool they
cut from my back?" said a great, black sheep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Baa, baa, baa! Who has carried off our
wool?" cried all the other sheep.</p>

<p>"I didn't carry off your wool," said Fannie.
"Stop, stop! that's my shawl. You mustn't
take that. What are you pulling the carpet
to pieces for?"</p>

<p>Without minding a word Fannie said, the
great, black sheep marched out of the room
with the shawl on its shoulders. All the
other sheep followed with pieces of carpet
folded over them.</p>

<p>Buzz, buzz, buzz! "What comes to the

<p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz! Where is our wax?"
said the queen bee.</p>

<p>"Hum, hum, hum! Who stole our wax?"
said all the bees.</p>

<p>"There is no wax here," said Fannie.</p>

<p>The bees flew about, crying, "Buzz, buzz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
buzz! Hum, hum, hum!" They seemed to
be very angry about something.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," exclaimed Fannie; "they have
all lighted on my doll and are nibbling away
her pretty face. Oh, my beautiful wax doll!
What shall I do? What shall I do?"</p>

<p>At that moment there was a great noise in
the hall. "I wonder what will come next,"
said Fannie. In trotted a troop of horses,
neighing loudly, "Who stole our flowing
manes? Who carried off our long, waving
tails?"</p>

<p>"Here they are," said a great, white horse,
and he began pulling the mattress into pieces.</p>

<p>"I shall have no bed to sleep on," thought
Fannie, as the horses went galloping out of
the room, with their mouths full of horsehair.</p>

<p>But what can be coming through the hall
now, making so much noise?</p>

<p>"Fannie! Fannie! Why don't you come
down to tea?" shouted Frank, bursting into
the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank," said she, "did you meet the
horses running downstairs?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Horses running downstairs! What are
you talking about, Fannie?"</p>

<p>"Why, some geese flew in through the
window, and took the feathers from my pillows.
A whole troop of horses came into my
room and tore the mattress to pieces. A
flock of sheep carried off the carpet, and a
swarm of bees has eaten up my doll's head."</p>

<p>"Your doll is lying in her cradle, with
cheeks as red as cranberries," said Frank.
"The carpet looks as pretty as ever; and
your bed has not been disturbed. Sister

</table>

<p>The morning sun was just rising over the
hills when Lambkin White opened his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
and scrambled to his feet. All around him
lay the sleeping flock.</p>

<p>One after another the sheep and lambs
awoke, and soon they were feeding on the
grassy hillside.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="p0123-illus.png" id="p0123-illus.png"></a>
   <img src="images/p0123-illus.png" alt="A herd of sheep" title="A herd of sheep" />
</div>

<p>After the morning meal the lambs began
to frolic. They raced across the pasture.
They bounded over the stones that lay in
their way. They seemed to plan their plays
as children do, and everywhere Lambkin
White was the leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly, he left his companions and ran
to a large, flat rock. Upon this he jumped
and stood waiting. Every lamb followed him.
What the new game was called in sheep
language no one can tell. But they chased
one another like boys in a game of tag.</p>

<p>The sun crept up the sky and the air grew
hotter. And now the sheep stopped eating
grass. They turned, all together, into a path
that led to their drinking place.</p>

<p>But to-day they could find no water.
Instead of the spring which had bubbled out
from under the great rock there were only
stones and dry sand.</p>

<p>Down the hill the flock slowly wound its
way, looking for water. But Lambkin White
did not walk with the flock. He ran here
and there. He climbed rocks and hid behind
trees. Indeed, could the mother sheep have
spoken, she would have called him a very
troublesome lambkin.</p>

<p>The pasture sloped down to a piece of low,
wet land. A wooden bridge or trestle had
been built across the marsh for a railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
track. Trains of cars rolled over this high
bridge nearly every hour of the day.</p>

<p>On came the sheep to the very edge of the
swamp. Here they found black mud, but
not a drop of water to drink.</p>

<p>Near the end of the trestle was a cask, or
water barrel, which had been sunk into the
ground. Lambkin White ran to the barrel
and looked in. There was some water in
the cask, and the thirsty lamb stretched his
neck farther and farther down to get a drink.
Before his mother could reach him he fell,
head foremost, into the water barrel.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

</table>

<p>Poor little lamb! The smooth sides of the
barrel were all around him and he could not
get out. The helpless mother was in great
distress, but what could she do? Her little
one was drowning before her eyes, and she
could not save him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>The lamb's wild struggles were growing
slower and slower. His limbs now moved
feebly. In a moment more the brave young
heart would stop beating. Soon there would
be one less in the flock. Soon there would
be a sad mother sheep calling in vain for
her little lamb.</p>

<p>Just then a shrill whistle sounded across
the marsh. Over the trestle came the great
locomotive dragging a train of cars filled with
passengers.</p>

<p>The foolish sheep, in their terror, ran along
the railroad track in front of the moving
train.</p>

<p>But Lambkin White's mother still stood
by the water cask. Nearer and nearer came
the terrible noise of the engine. The black
monster was coming directly toward her.
Soon it will be upon her!</p>

<p>Will she not run away from danger? Will
she not join the flock? No! for the mother
heart is brave and the mother love is strong.
If she can not save her darling, she can, at
least, die by his side.</p>

<p>The engineer was watching with sharp
eyes the flock of sheep on the track ahead.
He saw the lamb in the water barrel as the
engine came near the end of the trestle.
"Down brakes!" he whistled, and the train
suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>The passengers crowded to the windows.
What could be the matter? They saw the
engineer running. They saw him stoop down
and lift a little lamb from the sunken water
barrel. Its fleece was dripping with water.</p>

<p>The engineer placed the half-drowned creature
by its mother's side. And then what
a cheer arose from the passengers for the
kind deed which he had done.</p>

<p>The fireman drove the sheep from the track
and turned them toward the hillside pasture.
A brakeman pumped the water barrel full of
water for the thirsty flock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>Back ran the engineer to his engine. "All
aboard," shouted the conductor, as he swung
himself upon the last car of the rolling
train.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon a happy mother sheep
wandered back to the pasture with Lambkin
White following very slowly in her tracks.</p>

<p>There was once a little girl named Pearl,
who had a bad habit of telling untruths.
For a long time her father and mother did
not know this. But at last they found that
she very often said things that were not
true.</p>

<p>Now, at this time&mdash;for it was long, long
ago&mdash;there lived a wonderful man named
Merlin. He could do such strange things,
and he was so very wise, that he was called
a wizard.</p>

<p>Merlin was a great lover of truth. For
this reason children who told untruths were
often brought to him, so that he might cure
them of their fault.</p>

<p>"Let us take our child to the wonderful
wizard." said Pearl's father.</p>

<p>And the mother said, "Yes, let us take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
her to Merlin. He will cure her!" So
Pearl's parents went to the glass palace
where Merlin lived.</p>

<p>When they reached Merlin's palace, the
wise old man said, "I know very well what
is the matter with your child; she does not
love the truth."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/p0131-illus.png" alt="Pearl talking to Merlin" title="Pearl talking to Merlin" />
</div>

<p>Poor Pearl hid her head with shame and
fear. But Merlin said, "Do not be afraid.
I am only going to make you a present."</p>

<p>Then the wizard opened a drawer and took
from it a lovely necklace with a diamond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
clasp. This he put on Pearl's neck, and
told her parents to go home happy, for the
little girl would soon be cured.</p>

<p>As they were going away, Merlin looked
at Pearl, and said, "In a year from now I
shall come for my necklace. Till then you
must not dare to take it off."</p>

<p>Can you guess what the necklace was?
It was the wonderful Necklace of Truth.</p>

<p>Next day Pearl went to school. When her
schoolmates saw the beautiful necklace, they
crowded around her.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a lovely necklace! Where did
you get it, Pearl?"</p>

<p>"My father gave it to me for a Christmas
present," said Pearl.</p>

<p>"Oh, look, look!" cried the children.
"The diamond has turned dim!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Pearl looked down at her necklace and
saw that the lovely clasp was changed to
coarse glass. Then she was very much
afraid, and said, "I will tell you the truth:
the wizard Merlin gave it to me."</p>

<p>At once the diamond was as bright as
before.</p>

<p>The girls now began to laugh, because
they knew that only children who told
falsehoods were sent to Merlin.</p>

<p>"You need not laugh," said Pearl. "Merlin
sent a lovely coach to bring us. It was drawn
by six white horses, and was lined with satin,
and had gold tassels."</p>

<p>She stopped, for all the children were laughing
again. Then she looked at her necklace,
and&mdash;what do you think? It hung down to
the floor! At each false word she had spoken,
the necklace had stretched out more and more.</p>

<p>"You are stretching the truth!" cried the
little girls.</p>

<p>Then Pearl confessed that all she had told
them was false; and at once the necklace
changed to its right size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what did Merlin say when he gave
you the necklace?"</p>

<p>"He said it was a present for a truthful&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could not go on speaking. The necklace
became so short that it nearly choked
her.</p>

<p>"O dear, no!" sobbed Pearl. "He said
I did not love the truth, nor speak the
truth."</p>

<p>The girls did not laugh now. They were
sorry for Pearl when they saw her weeping.</p>

<p>At last Pearl was cured. She saw how
wrong and how foolish it is to tell falsehoods.
"Never more will I tell a lie," said
she. And she kept her word.</p>

<p>Before the year was ended Merlin came
for his necklace. He knew that Pearl did
not need it now, and he wanted it for
another little girl.</p>

<p>Since Merlin died, no one can tell what
has become of the wonderful Necklace of
Truth. Would you like to wear it? Are
you sure the diamond would always keep
bright?</p>

<h2><a name="SAINT_VALENTINE" id="SAINT_VALENTINE">SAINT VALENTINE</a></h2>


<p>Here is one of the many stories that
have been told about Saint Valentine.</p>

<p>Father Valentine was a priest who lived a
long time ago. He spent his time in nursing
the sick and in comforting the sorrowing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
As he went about among his people,
the children, too, found a kind and helpful
friend.</p>

<p>They liked to talk with him, and to run
by his side as he went from one house to
another. What wonderful stories he told
them about the birds and the flowers! How
many beautiful things he taught them as
they walked together through the forest and
by the river!</p>

<p>Father Valentine loved all the little creatures
of the woods and the streams, and they
seemed to love him in return. The birds
would come at his call, and the squirrels
would scamper down the trees to take food
from his hand.</p>

<p>Years went by, and at last the good priest
became too old to visit his people. How they
must have wished to hear again the sound of
his footsteps at the door! How the children
must have missed their kind teacher and the
stories that he told!</p>

<p>Father Valentine was very sad because he
could no longer go about from home to home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
But he soon found a way by which he could
still be of use to those he loved.</p>

<p>As he sat in his room he wrote the kind
words which had always made his visits so
full of good cheer. Every day his loving
messages were sent near and far. They were
carried by the boys and girls who had learned
from him to be happy in helping others.</p>

<p>Soon his friends began to watch for the
kind words that were sure to come to them
whenever they were in need of help. Even
the little children, when they were ill, would
say, "I am sure that Father Valentine will
send me a letter to-day."</p>

<p>After a time the good father passed away
from earth, but he has not been forgotten.</p>

<p>Each year, when the fourteenth of February
comes around, we still keep his birthday.</p>

</div>

<p>Here is a picture of a famous old house.
It was built more than one hundred years
ago, and it still stands, painted yellow and
white, as in the days of old. People come
from far and near to see it, and perhaps some
day you will visit it.</p>

<p>Do you wish to know why so many people
travel miles and miles to see this old place?</p>

<p>Two great men once lived here. The first
one was a brave general. Long ago he was
called from his own home to take command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of an army. In those days, the yellow and
white house was one of the finest places for
miles around. So it was given to the general
for his headquarters.</p>

<p>If these old walls could only speak, what
wonderful stories they could tell! For in
this house many plans were made, which
helped to bring freedom to our land.</p>

<p>We like to fancy that we can see the great
general going in and out of the front door.
He used to wear a three-cornered hat and
ruffled shirt bosom, knee-breeches, and low
shoes with silver buckles.</p>

<p>This brave and noble commander led his
army through many dangers to victory, and
he afterward became the first president of
the United States. You need not be told
that the great general who once lived in the
famous old house was George Washington.</p>

<p>After many years the old house became the
home of another great and good man. He
did not lead armies, nor make laws, nor hold
office. And yet few men in our country have
been so well known or so well loved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>His poems are read in all parts of the world,
and his beautiful thoughts have helped hundreds
and hundreds of people to love the
right and to hate the wrong.</p>

<p>And now you are eager to speak the name
of the great poet who once lived in the famous
old house&mdash;Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.</p>

<p>The famous old house looks very quiet and
lonely in the picture. But there was a time
when many children ran
about its halls and played
upon the lawn.</p>

</div>

<p>"How many children did
Mr. Longfellow have? Did
he have any boys? What
were their names?"</p>

<p>These questions are asked
again and again by little
people who keep the birthday of the poet
and wish to learn about his life.</p>

<p>In his journal, Mr. Longfellow tells us about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
his children, and it is there we may find
answers to all our questions.</p>

<p>The poet's eldest son was named Charles.
When Charles was two years old his little
brother Ernest was born. Longfellow then
moved his books into another room and gave
up his study to his babies.</p>

<p>And so the room in which Washington had
planned battles became the nursery of the
Longfellow children. Did any children ever
have a more famous nursery?</p>

<p>In this room which once belonged to Washington
we like to think that the children
heard again and again the story of our first
President.</p>

<p>When Ernest was but a few days old his
father told a friend that the little newcomer
was a great musician. Do you know what the
poet meant by this?</p>

<p>While Charles and Ernest were still little
boys, their baby sister Fannie came to live in
the nursery. Just as she was old enough to
run about, the dear little girl died. Then the
house was full of sorrow. Many of the poems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Longfellow wrote at this time tell the story of
his grief at the loss of his little daughter.</p>

<p>Charles was six years old and Ernest four,
when their father first took them to school.
He left them sitting on little chairs among
the other children in an old house near a
large elm tree.</p>

<p>It was under this same tree that Washington
took command of the American army.</p>

<p>As time went on three little girls took the
places of the boys in the nursery. How all
these children loved their father! They
thought him the best playfellow in the world,
and so he was.</p>

<p>He made toys for them, taught them games,
and wrote letters which he placed under their
pillows for them to find in the morning.</p>

<p>Longfellow writes in his journal about
coasting with the boys for hours upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
hillside, and of working hard with all the
children making a snow house in the front
yard.</p>

<p>Again he tells of charming birthday parties
when children played in the hay and scrambled
for sugar plums. These parties always
ended with a fine birthday supper.</p>

<p>On the first of May the children sometimes
had a May party. The girls wore wreaths
upon their heads and danced around the May
pole. Then they all went to the summer
house for a feast.</p>

<p>In summer the Longfellow children often
went to the seaside with their father and
mother. All day long they played in the
sand and waded in the water.</p>

<p>But a great and terrible sorrow came suddenly
to the Longfellow home. One morning,
as Mrs. Longfellow was sealing a package
with hot wax, her dress caught fire. Before
the flames could be put out she was so badly
burned that she died soon after.</p>

<p>Never again was the poet full of joy as
he had always been before. For him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
happiness of life was over. But he never
forgot to provide for the pleasure of his children.</p>

<p>Longfellow has told us about his three
daughters in a beautiful poem called "The
Children's Hour." He has also written about
them in a letter to a little girl which you
will be glad to read.</p>

girls keep changing every year I can never
remember exactly how old she is, and have to
ask her mamma, who has a better memory
than I have. Her name is Alice. I never
forget that. She is a nice girl and loves
poetry almost as much as you do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The second is Edith, with blue eyes and
beautiful golden locks which I sometimes
call her nankeen hair to make her laugh.
She is a busy little woman and wears gray
boots.</p>

<p>The youngest is Allegra, which you know
means merry; and she is the merriest little
thing you ever saw&mdash;always singing and
laughing all over the house.</p>

<p>These are my three little girls, and Mr.
Read has painted them all in one picture
which I hope you will see some day.</p>

<p>They bathe in the sea and dig in the sand
and patter about the piazza all day long.
Sometimes they go to see the Indians encamped
on the shore, and buy baskets and
bows and arrows.</p>

<p>I do not say anything about the two boys.
They are such noisy fellows it is of no use
to talk about them.</p>

<p>And now, Miss Emily, give my love to
your papa, and good night with a kiss from
his friend and yours,</p>

<p>It is very interesting to know how George
Washington passed his boyhood. In many
ways he was no better than other boys. He
had a quick temper, and he soon found that
he must learn to control it.</p>

<p>But he wished to make a good and useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
man of himself. This story tells some of the
ways in which he tried to do this.</p>

<p>He had learned to survey land, and this
knowledge soon became of great use to him.
When he was sixteen years old, he went to
live with his brother Lawrence at Mount
Vernon.</p>

<p>He took his compass and surveyor's chain
with him. Nearly every day he went out
into the fields to measure his brother's land.</p>

<p>A tall, white-haired gentleman often came
into the fields to see what Washington was
doing, and to talk with him. This was Sir
Thomas Fairfax. He had lately come to
America from his home in England. He
owned thousands of acres of land in the new
country beyond the mountains.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas was very fond of hunting, and
he liked to have Washington go with him.
They often rode out together, and the old
Englishman came to like his young friend
very much. He saw that the boy was manly
and brave and very careful in all that he did.</p>

<p>"Here is a boy who likes to make himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
useful; I can trust him," he said. And Sir
Thomas soon made a bargain with young
Washington to survey his wild lands.</p>

<p>Washington loved out-of-door life, and he
was very fond of riding on horseback. So he
was glad to undertake the work of surveying
land for Sir Thomas.</p>

<p>One bright day in early spring the young
surveyor started out on his first trip across
the mountains. With him was a cousin of
Sir Thomas Fairfax. Each young man rode
a good horse and carried a gun.</p>

<p>As there were no roads in the wild country
they found their way through paths in the
forest. They climbed mountains and swam
rivers. At night they slept in a hunter's
cabin or by a camp fire in the woods.</p>

<p>Often they were wet and cold and without
shelter. They cooked their meat over the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
on forked sticks, and they used wooden chips
and leaves for plates.</p>

   <p class="caption2">George Washington, the Surveyor.</p>
</div>

<p>One day they met a band of Indians.
There were thirty of them, and their bodies
were half covered
with war
paint.</p>

<p>The Indians
seemed very
friendly. They
built a huge
fire under the
trees and
danced their
war dance.
One of them
drummed on
a deerskin
stretched over
an iron pot.</p>

<p>The others whooped and yelled as they
danced around the fire. It was a strange sight,
and the young men looked on with wonder.</p>

<p>For weeks Washington and his companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
lived in the forest. They found the best
places for hunting, and the best lands for
farms.</p>

<p>When they returned home Sir Thomas was
much pleased with all that the young men
told him about the new country. He made
up his mind to move across the mountains
and to spend the rest of his life upon his
own lands.</p>

<p>George was well paid for his work of
surveying. This was the first money he
had ever earned, and he enjoyed spending it
because he had worked hard for it.</p>

<h2><a name="ABRAHAM_LINCOLN" id="ABRAHAM_LINCOLN">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">His New Home</span></h3>

<p>In the autumn after Abraham Lincoln was
eight years old, his parents left their Kentucky
home and moved to Indiana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>They had no wagon, and all their household
goods were carried on the backs of two
horses. At night they slept on the ground,
sheltered only by the trees.</p>

<p>It was not more than fifty or sixty miles
from the old home to the new; but it was
a good many days before the family reached
their journey's end. Over a part of the
way there was no road. The movers had
sometimes to cut a path through the thick
woods.</p>

<p>The boy was tall and very strong for his
age. He already knew how to handle an ax,
and few men could shoot with a rifle better
than he. He was his father's helper in all
kinds of work.</p>

<p>It was in November when the family came
to the place which was to be their future
home. Winter was near at hand. There
was no house nor shelter of any kind. What
would become of the patient, tired mother,
and the gentle little sister?</p>

<p>Hardly had they reached the spot chosen for
their home than Lincoln and his father were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
at work with their axes. In a short time they
had built what they called a camp.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="p0160-illus.png" id="p0160-illus.png"></a>
   <img src="images/p0160-illus.png" alt="Boy working on schoolwork with mother" title="Boy working on schoolwork with mother" />
</div>

<p>This camp was but a rude shed made of
poles and covered with leaves and branches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
It was inclosed on three sides. The fourth
side was left open, and in front of it a fire
was built.</p>

<p>This fire was kept burning all the time.
It warmed the inside of the camp. A big
iron kettle was hung over it by means of a
chain and pole. In the kettle the fat bacon,
the beans, and the corn were boiled for the
family's dinner and supper. In the hot
ashes the good mother baked corn cakes, and
sometimes, perhaps, a few potatoes.</p>

<p>One end of the camp was used as a kitchen.
The rest of the space was the family sitting
room and bedroom. The floor was covered
with leaves, and on these were spread the
furry skins of deer and bears and other
animals.</p>

<p>In this camp the Lincoln family spent their
first winter in Indiana. How very cold and
dreary that winter must have been! Think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the stormy nights, of the howling wind, of the
snow and the sleet and the bitter frost! It is
not much wonder that the mother's strength
began to fail before the spring months came.</p>

<p>It was a busy winter for Thomas Lincoln.
Every day his ax was heard in the woods.
He was clearing the ground, so that in the
spring it might be planted. And he was
cutting logs for his new house. For he had
made up his mind, now, to have something
better than a cabin to live in.</p>

<p>The woods were full of wild animals. It
was easy for the boy and his father to kill
plenty of game, and thus keep the family
supplied with meat.</p>

<p>Lincoln, with chopping and hunting and
trapping, was very busy. He had but little
time to play. Since he had no playmates we
do not know that he even wanted to play.</p>

<p>With his mother he read over and over
the Bible stories which both of them loved
so well. And, during the cold, stormy days,
when he could not leave the camp, his
mother taught him how to write.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>In the spring the new house was built. It
was only a log house, with one room below
and a loft above. But it was so much better
than the old cabin in Kentucky that it
seemed like a palace.</p>

<p>The family moved into the new house
before the floor was laid, or any door was
hung at the doorway.</p>

<p>Then came the plowing and the planting
and the hoeing. Everybody was busy from
daylight to dark.</p>

<p>The summer passed, and autumn came.
Then the poor mother's strength gave out.
She could no longer go about her household
duties. She had to depend more and more
upon the help that her children could give her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>At length she became too feeble to leave
her bed. She called the boy to her side.
She put her arm around him and said:
"My boy, I shall very soon leave you. I
know that you will always be good and kind
to your sister and father. Try to live as I
have taught you, and to love your heavenly
Father."</p>

<p>Then she fell asleep, never to wake again
on this earth.</p>

<p>Under a big sycamore tree, half a mile
from the house, the neighbors dug the grave
for the mother of Abraham Lincoln. And
there they buried her in silence and in great
sorrow.</p>

<p>In all that new country there was no
church; and no minister could be found to
speak words of comfort and hope to the
grieving ones around the grave.</p>

<p>But the boy remembered a preacher whom
they had known in Kentucky. The name of
this preacher was David Elkin. If he would
only come!</p>

<p>And so, after all was over, the lad sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
down and wrote a letter to David Elkin.
Abraham was only a child nine years old,
but he believed that the good man would
remember his mother, and come.</p>

<p>It was no easy task to write a letter.
Paper and ink were not things of common
use, as they are with us. A pen had to be
made from the quill of a goose.</p>

<p>But at last the letter was finished and sent
to Kentucky. How it was carried I do not
know, for the mails were few in those days,
and postage was very high.</p>

<p>Months passed. The leaves were again on
the trees. The wild flowers were blossoming
in the woods. At last the preacher came.</p>

<p>He had ridden a hundred miles on horseback.
He had forded rivers and traveled
through pathless woods. He had dared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
dangers of the wild forest. And all in
answer to the lad's letter.</p>

<p>He had no hope of reward save that which
is given to every man who does his duty.
He did not know that there would come a
time when the greatest preachers in the
world would envy him his sad task.</p>

<p>And now the friends and neighbors gathered
again under the great sycamore tree.
The funeral sermon was preached. Hymns
were sung. A prayer was offered, and words
of comfort were spoken.</p>

<p>From that time forward the mind of
Abraham Lincoln was filled with high and
noble thoughts. In his earliest childhood his
mother had taught him to love truth and
justice, to be honest and upright among men,
and to honor God. These lessons he never
forgot.</p>

<p>Long afterward, when the world had come
to know him as a very great man, he said:
"All that I am, or hope to be, I owe to my
angel mother."</p>

<p>Hana is a little Japanese girl. Her name,
in the language of Japan, means flower or
blossom. If you should see her you would
say that she is as beautiful as the gayest
flower in the garden.</p>

<p>Tora is her brother and his name means
tiger. He is called Tora because his father
and mother wish him to be as strong and
as brave as a tiger.</p>

<p>Hana and Tora live in one of the beautiful
islands of Japan. Let us visit them
in their home on the other side of the world.</p>

<p>We must cross the ocean to reach this
far away land. So we go on board a great
steamer and for days and days we sail over
the sea.</p>

<p>At last we come to the city where our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
little friends live. We leave the ship and
climb into a two-wheeled carriage which is
drawn by a man. He runs along the street
with our carriage almost as fast as a horse
can trot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/p0168-illus.png" alt="Man pulling a rickshaw with a lady in it" title="Man pulling a rickshaw with a lady in it" />
</div>

<p>How strange everything seems. The men,
women, and children all wear gowns that
look like dresses. They clatter along in
wooden shoes, and they carry paper umbrellas.
We ride through narrow streets.
There are no sidewalks nor green lawns.</p>

<p>And now our carriage stops. We have
come to the home of Hana and Tora. The
front of the house is open like a doll's playhouse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
and we can see through to the garden
beyond.</p>

<p>How clean everything looks! The porch
shines like a mirror. All the floors are
covered with matting made of the whitest
straw. Even the road in front of the house
is swept.</p>

<p>We walk toward the house, and a little
girl comes in from the garden. She has a
clear yellow skin, bright black eyes, and
smooth black hair. This is Hana, and she
hastens to greet us.</p>

<p>She drops down on her knees, and bows so
low that her head touches the matting. Her
mother will soon be at home, Hana says, and
she begs us to come in.</p>

<p>Does she ask us to take off our hats? Oh,
no, she expects us to take off our shoes. The
Japanese always leave their shoes outside
when they go into a house.</p>

<p>Again and again the polite little girl bows
her head to the floor as we enter. We sit
down on the thick matting, for in the houses
of Japan there are no chairs.</p>

more bows and more greetings.</p>

<p>Tora is dressed in a plain blue gown very
much like his sister's. Both the children
have large pockets in their sleeves where
they carry their playthings.</p>

<p>Our friends invite us to spend the night
with them. We are very glad to do so. They
take us to the parlor, which is at the back of
the house.</p>

<p>It is now time for supper. A small table,
about ten inches high, is placed before each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
person in the room. We sit on the floor as
we eat. A little maidservant brings in cakes
and candies shaped like flowers. She kneels
and bows low as she hands them to us.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/p0171-illus.png" alt="Chinese people seated for a meal" title="Chinese people seated for a meal" />
</div>

<p>Next we have soup, which we drink from
small bowls. Then come pickles and strange
kinds of food that we have never before seen.
Last of all rice is served from a large, round,
wooden box, and we drink our tea from tiny
cups.</p>

<p>There are no knives and no forks, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
we observe our Japanese friends as they eat
with two long wooden sticks. Then we take
our chop sticks and try to eat the rice as they
do. Hana and Tora watch us, but they are
too polite to smile.</p>

<p>After the supper is over, the grown people
sit on the floor and talk to one another, or
watch the children at their games. Hana
and Tora play with small cards on which are
printed the strange-looking letters of the
Japanese alphabet.</p>

<p>And so the evening passes and bedtime
comes. The little maidservant takes us upstairs.
We see no beds, and we wonder where
we shall sleep. But screens are soon drawn
together, and a room is made for us.</p>

<p>Then the little maid slides back another
screen, and there in the wall is a closet. Out
of this she takes soft, thick quilts, and spreads
them on the matting, one on top of another.
For a pillow she brings each of us a small
block of wood.</p>

<p>We do not like the wooden pillows, but we
sleep soundly all night in our beds on the floor.</p>

<p>A beautiful garden lies back of the house
where Hana and Tora live.</p>

<p>In Japan the people love the flowering
trees and plant them in their gardens. Now
it is early springtime and the plum trees are
just beginning to burst into bloom.</p>

<p>The children ask us to go with them and
look for the first plum blossoms. The pink
buds are pushing out of their brown coverings.
"Oh, I am so glad!" Hana says. "Soon
the peach trees will bloom, and then it will
be time for the Doll Festival.</p>

<p>"How I wish I could show you my dolls!
I have more than a hundred, but they are all
packed away in the storehouse.</p>

<p>"Some of them are very old. They used
to belong to my grandmother and to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
great-grandmother. The doll I like best was
given to me when I was a baby. It is as
large as I am, and it can wear my clothes.</p>

<p>"When the Doll Festival comes I have a
merry time. In the morning when I get up
I find all my dolls waiting for me in the
guest room.</p>

<p>"With them are doll houses, little tables,
sets of dishes, and boxes full of pretty gowns
and sashes. The first thing I do is to dress
all the dolls in their best clothes.</p>

<p>"Of course they must have something to
eat, for it is the Feast of Dolls.</p>

<p>"I make tea for them and put dishes of
candy and cake and rice on their little tables.
It is not polite to leave anything on one's
plate, and so Tora and I have all the food
that the dolls do not eat.</p>

<p>"For three whole days I can play with my
dolls. Then I take off their beautiful clothes
and put on their sleeping coats. My mother
packs them in their boxes and stores them
away for another year, until the Feast of
Dolls comes again."</p>

<p>"Tora does not care for the Feast of
Dolls, because that is a girls' festival.
The Feast of Flags
is the boys' day."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Tora
says, "I think the
Flag Festival is the very
best day of the whole year.
Then everybody flies kites and the
boys have their feast.</p>

<p>"What fun it is to see the huge
paper fishes flying over all the houses
and gardens! Some of the fishes are
as large as a man. They open their
mouths and swim about in the air as
if they were in the water. All day
long they flap their fins and tails and rustle
in the wind."</p>

<p>"But why are so many of your kites made
like fishes?" we ask.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because there is one kind of fish in our
country so strong and brave that he swims up
stream and leaps the waterfalls," Tora answered.
"So Japanese parents fly kites made
like fishes to help their sons remember that
they must struggle bravely to win success.</p>

<p>"There are many kinds of fish, my father
says, that can float down the stream with the
current; but there is only one fish that can
swim up the stream and leap over a waterfall.</p>

<p>"We have many other kites too. Some of
them are shaped like butterflies. Some are
shaped like birds and they make a singing
noise when the wind blows through them.</p>
</div>
<p>"On the morning of the Flag Festival I
find all my toys in the guest room where
Hana finds her dolls.</p>

<p>"Among my toys are wooden soldiers
older than Hana's oldest dolls. My grandfather's
grandfather used to play with them
when he was a little boy.</p>

<p>"And there are banners and swords, and
images of the famous generals of Japan
dressed in splendid armor. My father always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
plays with me on the day of the Flag Festival,
and he tells me about the brave soldiers
of our country.</p>

<p>"In the evening the people light their
prettiest paper lanterns, and hang them in
the gardens and before every house and store.</p>

<p>"Sometimes my father takes me boat-riding,
and the most beautiful sight of all is
the river with the many colored lights twinkling
from the boats."</p>

<p>Hana and Tora tell us about other great
festivals of their country, and they invite
us to visit them again at the time of the
Feast of Cherry Blossoms.</p>

<p>We say that a room with no furniture in
it is empty. But this is not exactly true.
There is one thing that the room is full of to
its very top. It is something that you can
not see. But it is as real a thing as the
furniture. This thing is air.</p>

<p>If you take all of your books out of the
box in which you keep them, you say there
is nothing left in it. But the box is full of
air. When you shut it up and put it away,
you put away a box full of air. When the
books were in it, it was full of books and air
together. Now it is full of air alone.</p>

<p>The air is everywhere. It is always ready
to go where there is a place for it. Every
crack and crevice is filled with it.</p>

<p>You see a little boy playing with a ball.
What is it that he is throwing against the
wall? It is a rubber ball, you say. But is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
this all? Is there not something else besides
the rubber?</p>

<p>Suppose that you prick a hole in the ball
and squeeze it. It is now good for nothing.
But the rubber is all there. Why is the ball
good for nothing?</p>

<p>It is because the air which filled the ball
and made it round has escaped. The ball is
of no use unless you can keep it full of air.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think that air does not weigh
anything. But it does weigh something,
though very little, and its weight is well
known.</p>

<p>You can not see air, but you can sometimes
feel it. You can not feel it while it is still if
you are still at the same time. You can feel
it only when it is in motion. When the wind
blows upon you, it is air in motion that you
feel.</p>

<p>When you fan yourself, the air strikes upon
your face, and you feel it. When there is
a gust of wind, the air comes against you
just as a wave of water does.</p>

<p>Sometimes we say the wind blows very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
hard or very strong. This is when the air
moves very fast. When there is only a gentle
breeze, the air is moving very slowly.</p>

<p>When the air moves very fast, it sometimes
does a great deal of harm. It roots up trees
and blows down houses.</p>

<p>The air is clear, like glass. That is, it lets
you see through it. But when you look up
through the air, you see that it is of a blue
color. You call the blue air the sky. The
sky is the blue air that surrounds the earth.</p>

<p>There is a mighty giant in the world, who
is as old as the earth itself. You have often
heard his voice and felt his touch, but you
have never seen his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>When he is angry, all men fear, and all the
beasts of the field seek their hiding places.</p>

<p>As he rages and whirls along his way, he
tosses houses into the air as easily as a boy
tosses a ball. He throws down great trees or
pulls them up by the roots as he crashes
through the forest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="p0186-illus.png" id="p0186-illus.png"></a>
   <img src="images/p0186-illus.png" alt="A ship on the ocean" title="A ship on the ocean" />
</div>

<p>Sometimes he flies out over the sea and
chases the ships. He rolls great waves over
their decks and drives the ships against the
rocks to perish.</p>

<p>But he plays many a queer prank even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the midst of his anger. One day he lifted a
schoolhouse, turned it around in the air,
and set it down with the back of the house
just where the front had been.</p>

<p>Once when he was tumbling down houses
with a great racket, he found a baby in a
cradle. Catching it up, he was off like a flash.</p>

<p>Where had he taken the baby? Would it
ever be found alive? "Never," the people said.
But just then a cry was heard, and there was
the little child safe in the branches of a tree!</p>

<p>This giant meddles with everything within
his reach. He knocks the apples off the
trees before they are ripe. He tears the
vines from the house, and picks the flowers
from their stalks.</p>

<p>He is not always honest, for on washing
days he often tries to steal the clothes from
the line. He takes things which boys and
girls leave in the yard, or on the doorstep.</p>

<p>Then the old giant goes whistling on his
way to hide his stolen goods. Sometimes he
throws them under the bushes, and sometimes
he tosses them into the water.</p>

<p>The unseen giant is often kind and gentle.
In the long, hot summer time he softly fans
sick children, and helps them to become
strong and well again.</p>

</div>

<p>When he wishes, he can be one of the
greatest workers in the world. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
he flies from town to town sweeping the
streets. He draws water for thirsty cattle,
and he grinds wheat and corn for any miller
that asks his help.</p>

<p>Up and down the rivers, and over the sea,
he works by day and by night, carrying people
where they wish to go. Had it not been
for him, neither Columbus nor the Pilgrims
could have reached the shores of America.</p>

<p>He likes to play with boys and girls.
Sometimes he is a little rough. But when
there are kites to fly or boats to sail, he is
the best playfellow that can be found.</p>

<p>The strong old giant is very fond of music,
too. He loves to play on the horn, the bugle,
and the flute. Sometimes you hear him
whistling in the keyhole and singing in the
chimney. Often he flies to the pine forests,
where he makes the sweetest, saddest music
you have ever heard.</p>

<p>Everything you have heard about this wonderful
giant is true. And when you think
of his name, you will remember many other
things that he can do.</p>

<p>The young bird needs to be educated just
as a child needs to be, though not exactly
in the same way.</p>

<p>After the young bird can fly, he needs to
be taught to find his own food, and also
where to sleep.</p>

<p>He needs to know the different calls and
cries of his family, and what they all mean.
He has to learn to fly, and he must learn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
sing. Then he must learn what to be afraid
of, and how to protect himself from his enemies.
No doubt there are many lessons for
him to learn that we do not know about.</p>

<p>If you watch little birds just out of the
nest, you may see them being taught how to
find their food.</p>

<p>The robin mother takes her little one to
the ground and shows him where the worms
live, and how to get them. The owl mother
finds a mouse creeping about in the grass.
She teaches the owlets how to pounce upon
it by doing it herself before them.</p>

<p>The old swallow takes her young ones into
the air and shows them how to catch little
flies on the wing.</p>

<p>If you watch long enough, you may see
the old bird, who is training a young one,
fly away. She may leave the young one
alone on a tree or on the ground and be
gone a long time.</p>

<p>Before many minutes the little one will
begin to call for food. But by and by, if nobody
comes to feed him, he will look around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
for something to eat. Thus he will get his
first lesson in finding food for himself.</p>

<p>Once I saw a woodpecker bring his little
one to a fence close by some raspberry
bushes. He fed the young bird two or three
raspberries, and then quietly slipped away.</p>

<p>When the young bird began to feel hungry,
he cried out; but nobody came. Then he
looked over at the raspberries and tried to
reach one. After trying three or four times
he got one. Then how proud he was!</p>

<p>The father stayed away an hour or more.
Before he came back that young woodpecker
had learned to help himself very well. But
the minute his father came, he began to flutter
his wings and beg to be fed.</p>

<p>It is very easy to see the birds teaching
their little ones to fly. You will find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
young birds sitting quietly on fences or trees.
All at once the parents begin to fly around,
with strange, loud calls. In a minute the
little birds will fly out and join them.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
   <a name="p0194-illus.png" id="p0194-illus.png"></a>
   <img src="images/p0194-illus.png" alt="Baby bird at nest" title="Baby bird at nest" />
</div>

<p>Around and around they all go till their
little wings are
tired, and then they
come down and
alight again.</p>

<p>Once I saw a
young crow who
did not fly when
his parents called.
All the others flew
around many times.</p>

<p>The mother's
sharp eyes saw her
naughty son. She flew right at him, and
knocked him off his perch. The next time
she called, he flew with the rest.</p>

<p>An old robin wanted to teach her young
one to bathe. She brought him to a dish of
water kept for their use by some people who
were fond of birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>The little one stood on the edge and
watched his mother go in and splash and
scatter the water. He fluttered his wings
and was eager to try it for himself, but
seemed afraid to plunge in.</p>

<p>At last the mother flew away and left him
standing there. In a moment she came back
with a worm in her mouth. The young robin
was hungry, as young birds always are.
When he saw the worm, he began to flutter
his wings and cry for it.</p>

<p>But the mother jumped into the middle of
the water dish and stood there, holding the
worm in his sight. The little bird wanted
the worm so much that he seemed to forget
his fear and hopped in beside his mother.</p>

<p>She fed him, and then began to splash
about. The little fellow stayed in the water
and took a good bath.</p>

<p>A careful watcher can see the birds teach
many interesting things to their young ones.
But one must be quiet and patient, and not
frighten the birds.</p>

<p>Nandi, the Great One, was the baby's
nurse. He was one of the strongest nurses
that ever took care of a baby anywhere on
this round earth.</p>

<p>In the first place Nandi was large, as you
have already guessed. He was twice as high
as the baby's father, and he was almost as
tall as the roof of the tiny hut where the
baby lived.</p>

<p>Nandi had a long nose. It was a very
long nose indeed. Perhaps you will not
believe it, but his nose was as long as you
are tall, my little reader.</p>

<p>And it was a wonderful nose. It was
always moving, always feeling, always smelling.
With his nose Nandi could rock the
cradle, and brush away the flies that buzzed
about the baby's face. With it he could pick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
up the smallest toys from the ground, or
open the door of the hut.</p>

<p>But you, my little readers, have another
name for this wonderful, long nose. You call
it a trunk.</p>

<p>Nandi had two long, sharp teeth. They
were longer than a man's arm, and they were
very strong. With them he could lift heavy
logs and move great stones.</p>

<p>But you have another name for these long,
strong teeth. You call them tusks. And
you have already guessed that the baby's
nurse was an elephant.</p>

<p>The baby was a little Hindu boy, and he
lived on the other side of the world. He had
a brown skin, black eyes, and black hair.</p>

<p>The Hindu baby had played with great
Nandi's trunk ever since he could grasp anything
with his tiny hands. He had crawled
around the elephant's feet and slept on the
ground in the shadow of the great beast.
For, in the warm country of India, where the
baby lived, it is always summer.</p>

<p>One morning, the baby's father perched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
himself upon the elephant's head and rode
away from his home. The child screamed
with grief for his companion.</p>

<p>"Be still, love of my life," said the mother.
"Thy father has need of Nandi. He can no
longer be idle. There is harder work for him
to do than to care for thee, O small one."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="p0199-illus.png" id="p0199-illus.png"></a>
   <img src="images/p0199-illus.png" alt="Elephant lifting lumber" title="Elephant lifting lumber" />
</div>

<p>The elephant's work was to pile heavy
timbers in the lumber yard, and to help
unload the ships. Often he worked alone,
for he needed no driver to urge him to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
task. His piles of wood were always
straight, and his work always well done.</p>

<p>Once Nandi belonged to a Hindu prince
and walked in long processions through the
streets of cities. Then he wore gold rings in
his ears and silver rings around
his tusks. Red cloth, trimmed
with gold, covered his great
sides and hung almost to
his feet. And he proudly
bore upon his back the
officers of the prince.</p>

<div id="i0200">

<div id="i020006">&nbsp;</div>
<div id="i020007">&nbsp;</div>

<p>And longer ago than
that, when he was
young, he had
lived in the jungle.
Ah! those were happy
days! Then, with other
elephants, he roamed the forest, ate the
tender branches, and swam the rivers.</p>

<p>But one day he was driven by the hunters
through the forest and across the hills. Suddenly
he found himself shut in on every side
by a strong, high fence. Then he was caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and chained to a tame elephant who afterwards
taught him how to work.</p>

<p>Nandi often took part in great hunts for
wild beasts, and he bore the marks of a fierce
tiger's claws upon his side. He helped to
catch other elephants in the dark forest, and
taught great beasts like himself to do many
kinds of work.</p>
</div>
<p>Nandi did not care to be free. Truly, if
he had wished to go back to the jungle what
could hinder? For he worked without chain
or harness.</p>

<p>He was well cared for. He loved the
evening bath in the river and the evening
meal of fresh leaves. He loved his master,
who was always kind.</p>

<p>But best of all he loved the brown baby
who fed him with bananas, and always welcomed
his return with childish glee. How
old Nandi's bright eyes would sparkle when
his little friend came near.</p>

<p>And when the baby could run to meet him,
and sit upon his great strong neck, there was
no prouder elephant in all the land of India.</p>

<p>"Sister, I wish you would tell me a story
about the sun," said Harry. "Where does
it go at night, and where does it come from
in the morning?"</p>

<p>"We live on a big round globe called the
earth," replied his sister, "and we travel
around the sun once every year. The sun
is like a great lamp in the sky. When we
face the lamp, we see the light, and when
we turn away from it, we are in darkness.</p>

<p>"As the earth travels around the sun, it
whirls like a huge top. When the side of
the earth on which we live is turned toward
the sun, we have day. But when the earth
turns around so that the sun can not shine
on us, we have night.</p>

<p>"If the sun stopped shining, there would
be no daylight, and soon there would be no
heat on the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"The sun is very, very hot. If it should
come nearer and nearer to the earth, every
plant and animal in the world would die.
The rivers and the seas would dry up, and
at last the great earth would melt like a ball
of wax."</p>

<p>"How far away is the sun?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"It is so far away that it would take more
than a hundred years to travel the distance
by the fastest railroad train."</p>

<p>"Is it more than a thousand miles?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is more than a million miles."</p>

<p>"Suppose there were a road all the way to
the sun. How long would it take me to walk
there?"</p>

<p>"Let me see," said sister Mary, taking out
her notebook. "If you should walk four miles
an hour and ten hours a day, you would be
more than six thousand years old before you
could finish your journey."</p>

<p>"But suppose," asked Harry, his eyes
bright with wonder, "some one fired a big
cannon at the sun. How long would it take
the cannon ball to get there?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary looked in her notebook again. "If
a cannon ball could be shot to the sun, it
would take nine years to reach it. Now what
else do you want to know about the sun,
little brother?"</p>

<p>"I should like to know how large it is.
Does any one know? Is it as large as the
earth?"</p>

<p>"Very much larger," replied Mary. "It
is so large that if it were cut up into a million
parts, each one of the parts would be larger
than the earth.</p>

<p>"If a train should run at the rate of a
mile a minute, it would take five years for it
to go around the sun. A train going at the
same rate could travel the distance around
the earth in less than three weeks."</p>

<p>"Then the sun must be very large," said
Harry. "It is larger than anything I ever
heard about. Let us call it Giant Sun."</p>

<p>"There are stars far away in the sky that
are larger than the sun," said his sister.
"And there are planets like our earth which
are near the sun. But I will tell you about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
them some other day. Now do not forget
what I have told you about Giant Sun."</p>

<p>"Forget! How could I, sister? It is
better than any fairy tale I have ever heard.
Why, you have told me enough about Giant
Sun to keep me thinking all day."</p>

</div>

<p>Do you remember the beautiful picture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Aurora, and the story of Apollo, the driver of
the sun car? Here is another picture of the
sun chariot, in its flight across the heavens.</p>

<p>Once upon a time Phaethon, the son of
Apollo, said to his mother, "I go to-day to
my father's palace," and he started for the
land of the sunrise.</p>

<p>For days and for nights he traveled until
he came to a high mountain. On its top
was the shining palace of the sun. It had
golden columns and silver doors. On its
wall were pictures of the wonders of the
earth and of the sea.</p>

<p>But Phaethon hurried by these beautiful
sights. He entered the great hall and found
the Sun god just ready to drive his horses
through the clouds of dawn.</p>

<p>"Welcome, welcome, my son!" said Apollo.
"I have waited long for thy coming. What
is thy wish? Tell me, and thy wish shall
be granted thee."</p>

<p>"Oh, my father," said Phaethon, "let me
drive the chariot of the sun for one day
across the sky."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"No hand but mine can hold these fiery
horses," said Apollo. "Change thy wish, foolish
boy. You ask for death, not for honor."</p>

<p>"My father never breaks his promise," said
Phaethon. "I will not change my wish."</p>

<p>"Then follow my advice," said Apollo.
"Hold fast the reins. Use not the whip,
and drive neither too high lest the earth
freeze, nor too low lest it burn."</p>

<p>Phaethon sprang into the sun car and
grasped the lines. The horses darted across
the sky. Lower and lower they plunged.
The heat of the shining sun car dried the
lakes and the rivers, and burned every green
thing upon the land.</p>

<p>The people cried for rain, and the great
ruler of earth and air heard their cries, and
looked down from his dwelling place. He
flashed his lightnings at the mad driver, and
hurled him from his seat.</p>

<p>Then the great ruler led the horses and the
chariot to their old track across the sky.
But Phaethon never rose from the cold waters
of the river into which he had fallen.</p>

<p>Clytie was a sea maiden, so the old Greek
stories tell us. She lived at the bottom of
the ocean. The white sea sand was her carpet,
a beautiful shell was her bed, and the
seaweed was her pillow.</p>

<p>One morning Clytie arose, put on her moss-green
dress, and went to ride in her seashell
boat. A pair of fishes drew her over the
beautiful sea bottom. They swam around
rocks with sharp, ragged edges, and they
passed through forests of sea weed and coral.</p>

<p>Indeed, so long and pleasant was the ride
that Clytie fell asleep, and she did not awaken
until a big wave rolled her boat upon the
shore of a green island.</p>

<p>Then the little maiden opened her brown
eyes very wide, for she had never before seen
the land. There was green grass at her feet,
and such flowers as never grew in her garden
at the bottom of the deep sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>In the trees were birds whose songs sounded
sweeter than the music of the waves that
had so often lulled her to sleep.</p>

<p>Across the blue sky rode the Sun king in a
chariot which shone like blazing gold.</p>

<p>Clytie saw that all living things looked up
and smiled when the golden chariot rolled
above the earth.</p>

<p>"Oh, that I were a land child!" she said;
"then I too might gaze upon the Sun king
the whole day long."</p>

<p>Day after day the sea maiden came to the
island. There she stood hour after hour
watching the bright Sun king until his golden
chariot sank into the western sea.</p>

<p>But one evening Clytie found that she could
not move. Behold, she was no longer a maid
of the sea. Her dress was but a slender green
stalk with dark green leaves.</p>

<p>Her yellow hair had become a circle of
golden petals. From their midst looked out
the brown eyes of Clytie, no longer a sea
maiden, but a beautiful sunflower with its

<p>A little four-year-old girl stood in her
room making pictures upon the white walls.
On every side could be seen drawings of
horses and dogs, cows, rabbits, and sheep.
The walls were covered with pictures as high
as the chubby hand could reach.</p>

<p>In the doorway stood the father, watching
his little daughter. So wonderful were her
drawings for a little child that the neighbors
often came into the tiny room to look at the
pictures on the walls.</p>

<p>"My little Rosa will be an artist some
day," said the father, "but she can never be
a great artist because she is a girl. How I
wish she were a boy!"</p>

<p>In those days it was not thought proper for
a girl to do anything that would take her
away from home. "A girl should stay in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
house," people said. "She should spend her
time in sewing and in helping her mother."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/p0215-illus.png" alt="Rosa Bonheur." title="Rosa Bonheur." />
   <p class="caption2">Rosa Bonheur.</p>
</div>

<p>Rosa Bonheur's home was in France. She
was the eldest of four children. Her father
gave lessons in drawing and made pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
for books. The little cottage in which she
was born was in a beautiful part of the
country. Here, with her two younger
brothers and a baby sister, she lived a
happy life.</p>

<p>Rosa loved animals, and she had many
pets. Dogs that had no home came to her,
and they were never turned away. She
fed the wild rabbits and tamed the squirrels.
If a stray horse wandered by, it was given
food and water, and cared for until its owner
could be found.</p>

<p>The child artist drew pictures of all these
animals. She studied them as they ran or
walked or lay down to rest.</p>

<p>When her little brothers were old enough
to run about, they loved to follow their sister
from place to place. Often they went with
her to the roadside, where she made pictures
for them in the sand with a pointed stick.</p>

<p>Sometimes her dogs came too and sat for
their pictures. The passers-by stopped to see
the rosy-cheeked little girl drawing animals
and landscapes along the sandy way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>In the long winter evenings Rosa amused
herself and her brothers by cutting pictures
of animals and people from pieces of paper.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="A_LITTLE_GIRL_WHO_PAINTED_ANIMALS" id="A_LITTLE_GIRL_WHO_PAINTED_ANIMALS">A LITTLE GIRL WHO PAINTED ANIMALS</a></h2>

<p>But this free and happy life came to an
end all too soon. When Rosa was seven
years old, the family moved to Paris, where
they lived in small rooms. The street was
crowded with houses, and there was no yard
for the children to play in.</p>

<p>How Rosa longed for her old home and for
the animals she loved. Sometimes she ran
across the street to pet a wooden pig which
stood just outside the door of a meat shop.</p>

<p>About this time a great sorrow came to
the little Bonheur children. Their beautiful
mother died, and then they were all sent
away from home.</p>

<p>Poor little Rosa! She did not like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
study or sew, and she was very unhappy in
the girls' school to which she was sent.
Her only pleasure was in visiting her father's
studio. Here, if she could have a pencil, or
a bit of clay, she was always contented.</p>

<p>How she begged to leave school and stay
with her father! Her relatives thought this
a foolish thing for her to do. "What would
people think," they said, "to see a girl doing
a boy's work?"</p>

<p>One day, when her father returned to the
studio after a short absence, he found that
Rosa had painted a bunch of cherries. He
looked at her picture for a long time, and
then he said, "If you can do as well as that,
I will give you lessons."</p>

<p>"And I will cut off my hair and wear boy's
clothes," said Rosa. "Then I can study with
you, and no one will notice me." So she
dressed like a boy and went everywhere with
her father.</p>

<p>Lessons in drawing and painting now
began in earnest. It was not long before
she could help her father. Soon she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
able to copy pictures in the famous picture
galleries of Paris.</p>

<p>And now the girl who did not like to study
books, and who hated to sew, became one
of the hardest of workers. She painted from
early morning until night to earn money for
her father and the younger children.</p>

<p>At last the Bonheur family were able to
have a home together once more. In a quiet
street in Paris, up six flights of stairs, they
found a few small rooms.</p>

<p>But what should they do for a garden and
for a place to keep their animals? It was
Rosa's greatest wish to learn to draw and
paint animals from life, and she needed to
study living models.</p>

<p>The windows of their rooms opened on a
broad, flat roof. Here Rosa and her brother
made a roof garden and planted flowers.
Here they kept singing birds, a hen and
chickens, and a pet sheep.</p>

<p>Every morning the two boys carried the
sheep downstairs, and led it to the pasture.
In the evening they carried it up the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
flights of stairs to the studio. It was drawn
standing and lying down, eating and sleeping.
It was painted and modeled in clay, again
and again, by Rosa and her brothers.</p>

<p>Rosa Bonheur now spent all her time in
painting animals. She took long trips into
the country to find animals to sketch. There
she drew flocks of sheep, oxen at work, and
cows standing in the long grass.</p>

<p>Sometimes she went into pens where animals
were kept, both in the country and in
the city of Paris. Because her long skirts
were in the way of her work she often dressed
as men do.</p>

<p>Her pictures were shown in Paris with those
of great artists. When she was only nineteen
years old, she won her first prize. This was a
great honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>One of her finest pictures is called "Oxen
Plowing." It was finished just before her
father's death. He was greatly interested in
this picture. When it was done, he was proud
and happy to see that his daughter had become
a great artist.</p>

</div>

<p>Rosa Bonheur spent the last years of her
life in a home of her own, not far from Paris.
Near by was a beautiful forest, and in a park
close to the house she kept a number of wild
animals.</p>

<p>The studio in which the artist worked was
very interesting. Paintings hung on the
walls and stood about the room. Birds sang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
in their cages. Dogs and other pets walked
about or lay on the skins of wild animals
which covered the floor.</p>

<p>To this home came many poor people, whom
the great artist was always glad to help. She
was kind to every one, and even the animals
loved her.</p>

<p>A large lion named Nero was one of Rosa's
pets, and he often lay in the studio while she
painted her pictures.</p>

<p>Once, when she was leaving home for a
long trip, she was obliged to send Nero away.
On her return she went to see him in one of
the parks of Paris. She found him in a cage,
sick and blind.</p>

<p>"Nero, my poor Nero!" she exclaimed;
"what has happened to you?"</p>

<p>The poor beast heard her voice. He crawled
to the bars of the cage, where he could feel her
hand stroking his head. So great was the love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
he showed that Rosa had him taken again to
her home, and she cared for him as long as he
lived. He died clinging with his great paws
to the mistress he had loved so well.</p>

<p>Rosa Bonheur's most wonderful painting is
"The Horse Fair." The artist spent nearly
two years in drawing horses before she began
this great work. The picture is so large
that she was obliged to use a stepladder to
reach some parts of it.</p>

<p>"The Horse Fair" was bought by an American,
and it can be seen in the Museum of Art
in New York city.</p>

<p>When the French people wish to honor an
artist, they give him the cross of the Legion
of Honor. The Empress had often seen Rosa
Bonheur sketching in the forest, and she
thought her the greatest of animal painters.</p>

<p>One morning when Rosa Bonheur was
painting in her studio, the Empress came
into the room and hung a beautiful white
cross around the artist's neck.</p>

<p>No woman had ever before worn the cross
of the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p>When Benjamin Franklin was a boy there
were no great public schools as there are
now. But Benjamin learned to read almost
as soon as he could talk, and he was always
fond of books.</p>

<p>His nine brothers were older than he, and
every one had learned a trade. They did not
care so much for books.</p>

<p>"Benjamin shall be the scholar of our
family," said his mother.</p>

<p>And so, when he was eight years old, he
was sent to a grammar school. He studied
hard, and in a few months he was promoted
to a higher class. But his father was poor
and needed his help. In two years he was
obliged to leave school.</p>

<p>Benjamin was a small boy, but there were
many things that he could do. His father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
was a soap boiler, and candle maker. And
so when the boy was taken from school, what
kind of work do you think he had to do?</p>

<p>You may be sure that Benjamin was kept
busy. He cut wicks for the candles, poured
the melted tallow into the candle molds, and
sold soap to his father's customers.</p>

<p>Do you suppose that he liked to do this
work?</p>

<p>He did not like it at all. And when he
saw the ships sailing in and out of Boston
Harbor, he longed to be a sailor, and go to
strange, far-away lands, where candles and
soap were unknown.</p>

<p>Benjamin's father saw that his boy did not
like the work he was doing. One day he
said: "Benjamin, since you do not wish to
be a candle maker, what trade do you think
you would like to learn?"</p>

<p>"I would like to be a sailor," said the
boy.</p>

<p>"I do not wish you to be a sailor," said his
father. "I intend that you shall learn some
useful trade on land; and I know that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
will do best the kind of work that is most
pleasant to you."</p>

<p>The next day he took the boy to walk with
him among the workshops of Boston. They
saw men busy at all kinds of work.</p>

<p>Benjamin was delighted. Long afterwards,
when he had become a very great man, he
said, "It has ever since been a pleasure to me
to see good workmen handle their tools."</p>

<p>He gave up the thought of going to sea,
and decided that he would learn any trade
his father would choose for him.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Benjamin's brother James
set up a printing press in Boston. He intended
to print books and a newspaper.</p>

<p>"Benjamin loves books," said his father.
"He shall learn to be a printer."</p>

<p>And so, when he was twelve years old, he
was sent to his brother to learn the printer's
trade. He was to have his board and clothing,
but no wages.</p>

<p>Benjamin never attended school again, but
he kept on studying. At that time there
were no books written for children as there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
are nowadays. His father's books were not
easy to understand. We should think them
very dull.</p>

<p>But before he was twelve years old, Benjamin
had carefully read the most of them.
All the money that came into his hands he
laid out in books.</p>

<p>Often he would borrow a book in the evening,
and then sit up nearly all night reading
it so as to return it early in the morning.</p>

<p>He spent all his spare time in studying
and reading the best books that he could
get. We shall find that afterward Benjamin
Franklin became the most learned man in
America.</p>

<p>t was a spring morning
more than one hundred
years ago. A young man
was plowing in a field
near a low farmhouse.</p>

<p>Four men with guns on
their shoulders passed along
the road. "There is Abner White," said
one of them. "He ought to join the army.
Call to him."</p>

<p>"Abner, Abner," they shouted.</p>

<p>The young man left his plow and ran to
the fence.</p>

<p>"We are raising a company to join Washington's
army," they said. "We march
to-morrow. You must go with us, Abner."</p>

</div>

<p>Abner walked quickly to the little farmhouse.
His mother was standing in the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"My country needs me, mother," he said.
"What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"If you feel it is your duty to fight for
your country, Abner, you must go," answered
the brave woman. "When will the new company
march?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"To-morrow!" exclaimed Mrs. White.
"You can not wear those old trousers. We
must make you a new pair."</p>

<p>"A soldier can not wait for new clothes,
and I must march with my company. A pair
of trousers can not be made in a day."</p>

<p>"We shall see," thought his mother, as she
hurried away to call her daughters.</p>

<p>"Is there any woolen cloth in the house,
Nancy?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not a yard; I used the last yesterday."</p>

<p>"And there is no yarn, either," said Deborah,
the oldest daughter.</p>

<p>"The sheep have not been sheared, and
there is no wool. It is not possible to make
Abner a new pair of trousers before he goes.
There is no use to try!" said Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can never tell what we can do until
we try," replied the mother. "Where are
the sheep?"</p>

<p>"They are in the pasture. I'll catch them,"
offered Silas, the younger son.</p>

<p>"And I'll help," said little Faith. "I'll
get some salt to coax them with."</p>

<p>The children ran to the pasture. "Nan,
Nan, Nan, Nan," they called. And the sheep
came running for the salt.</p>

<p>Nancy was hurrying to the field with a
pair of large shears in her hand. "Catch
that black sheep if you can," she shouted.</p>

<p>Silas caught and held the sheep, while
Nancy cut off the long, black wool.</p>

<p>"Here is a white sheep with beautiful
wool," called out Faith.</p>

<p>Silas put his arms around the patient animal,
and Nancy cut off its fine white wool.</p>

<p>"You may carry in all the wool we have,
Faith," said Nancy. "Silas and I will keep
on shearing until we have enough."</p>

<p>The wool was quickly combed by Deborah,
for there was no time to wash the newly cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
fleece. Very soon the mother commenced to
spin. How the spinning wheel buzzed as it
twisted the soft wool into yarn!</p>

<p>Nancy threaded the loom. Deborah wound
the shuttle full of new yarn, and the weaving
of the cloth began.</p>

<p>Back and forth the shuttle flew, Deborah
and Nancy taking turns. Late at night the
cloth was woven, and Abner's new trousers
were cut out. All night long the sewing
went on, every stitch by hand.</p>

<p>The next day at noon Silas sat on the gatepost
watching. Rub-a-dub-dub, rub-a-dub-dub,
came the sound of drums.</p>

<p>"Here they come! Here they come! tell
mother," he shouted.</p>

<p>They all hurried to the fence to see the
soldiers march by.</p>

<p>Abner held his musket proudly as he
passed. He glanced at his mother and then
down at his new trousers.</p>

<p>"No one looks finer than our Abner," said
Deborah, as the soldier boys marched by on
their way to the war.</p>
